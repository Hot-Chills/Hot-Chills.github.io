				Hey guys! I&#039;m Mosher or untitled, I&#039;m applying to become a jmod or mod or anything I can get. I was once a jmod or mod (idk If I ever got promoted) I eventually got demoted because of inactivity, back then I ended up leaving cs2d because my pc stopped working. I&#039;ve been back for a couple of months now and I&#039;m back in the competetive scene of cs2d but there&#039;s obviously those times where I&#039;d like to be on cs2d and no one from the competetive side is really playing or maybe I just want to have some simple fun and that is pretty much why I play on HC Fun.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Usgn ID</span><br />100556 / Untitled<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen a lot of applicants talk about their in game skills (I don&#039;t see why this is necessary but okay).<br />I&#039;m, well I&#039;d like to say that I&#039;m good at the game or atleast above average not because I started to play in 2012 (not actually too long ago compared to most comp players) but I&#039;m above average because I play competetive games more then most. I&#039;m really good if we&#039;re talking about the current american situation where most americans have kinda left the game as a whole.<br />Apart from cs2d, I play other games like csgo, dota2, osu, etc. I&#039;m bad at most of them.<br />I also really like making fórum signatures and logos, I&#039;d link you to some but Idk if that&#039;s allowed since it&#039;s on another fórum.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Personal Info</span><br />I&#039;m a pretty out going type of person, I like music, cars, gaming, sports, graphics design and the list goes on.<br />I like to participate in intelectual conversations about different topics, I really enjoy helping out other users with mostly anything they need or might need. I play guitar ;). Netflix is life so yeah. I&#039;m actually 14 (15 on friday) so my school isn&#039;t that demanding because it&#039;s just middle school, that means I have a lot of free time to do different things and something I really enjoy doing is playing cs2d so yeah.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Why would I like to become jmod</span><br />I&#039;d like to become jmod because I remember how cool or fun it is from back in 2012-2013 and how helpful you can be to other users. I&#039;m not trying to throw any moderators under the bus but I&#039;ve seen some that have been asked for help like literal questions and they kinda ignore the players. I&#039;m not like that, I really enjoy responding to peoples questions and things like that. Then we have this one thing that everyone hates, hackers, so that kinda answers itself on its own. Also there&#039;s a lot of people who break the more simple rules and they obviously wont respect you if you&#039;re just another user (or vip w/e) and well as a mod they will.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">How active am I?</span> <br />I find that the server is very fun, as in I enjoy it so being on it isn&#039;t really a problem for me. I can&#039;t really give you a 100% time frame or anything like that but I&#039;m on cs2d atleast like 4-6 hours a day if there&#039;s something to do and being a mod on your server is something to do. <br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">How good is my English</span><br />It&#039;s my first language but I live in Mexico so my vocabulary isn&#039;t exactly the most Posh one out there. It&#039;s good like practically as good as anyone who lives in America, just that I don&#039;t speak or type like in a fancy way. If casual is good enough then you can kinda rate my english on this application. (I don&#039;t have an Accent btw).<br /><br />You guys seem to have a lot of moderators or even overall staff and I understand you might not really need that many more but accepting me would be really cool because I feel like I can be an important asset to your staff. Anyways, thanks for reading and I hope you guys like my app.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Glad to see you back, buddy! I would definitely vote for a yes due to his maturity and experiences in the game. He might not be the best but he wrecked pretty much many players. Good luck mate!
