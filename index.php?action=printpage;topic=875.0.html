				Can you please tell us what F2//Activity shows on the server. I play a few hours every day during different times. I believe I would have seen you sometimes regardless of the timezones if you were active enough.<br /><br />It would be silly from me to vote without having talked with you at least once or seen you acting as a moderator, I just wanted to point out the lack of encounter.

				I do not understand why you apply for promotion if you play and moderate on other server(s).<br /><br />I haven&#039;t seen you in the last week either, that should make your inactivity argument invalid.

				Man, I mean I moderate more jail because at my time last week server was having bots and it&#039;s a valid reason for me to be inactive because of my screen.
