				1- Breif Introduction, <br />Hello everyone, my name is Marin, im 16 years old, im from Croatia. My nick in game is BG # m&amp;m or StormConsola.<br /><br />USGN ID/number: Mr_Magnifice/111149<br />and i would like to be a moderator on server HC Fun<br /><br />2- Personal information:<br />I play football in free time. On computer i like to play PES14 or sometimes with friends FIFA14 and of course cs2d. No offense lovers FIFA xd. I still learning English ( i learn that language with game cs2d ). I play cs2d 4 years, i leading m3 clan (BG). Also as i said i like to play cs2d, most of popular servers &quot;died&quot; so i play only on BG # Shotgun, HC # Fun and FWS # Doghouse. <br /><br />3- How good is my English:<br /><br />Well if i will rate myself (1-10) I&#039;II give grade 6.<br /><br />4- Skills in-game<br /><br />-Well, i play that game 3-4 years, most of time i play m3 and on fun servers .7.5/10<br />I learn some of lua scripting, but still i know the basics.<br /><br />5-&nbsp; Why would you accept me:<br />I&#039;II be honest, i will play only 30-1h per day, weekends 2+ on HC server, but while i play there i will do my best. I have very good expirience of moderating. I just want help server to works better. You can be sure that i will not make a mistake.<br /><br /><br />6- My personal opinion:<br />Check inactive moderators and kick them from that place, also give active players with expirience of moderating higher rank than vip. We seen every day hackers (speed,aimot etc.) but players on same team as that hacker are won&#039;t vote kick him, so vote kick (6- as i know) does not work as well.. Of course if are more than 10+ players on server it makes sense. <br /><br />Also im new on forum i didnt knew that are live xd, also i will be more active on forum.<br />I hope you understand all my English words, have in head that i still learning it.<br />Best regards, Marin :D cya in game! I hope you will accept me.&nbsp; :D

So if you do get accepted, check your activity in F2 &gt; Activity.<br />Good luck!
