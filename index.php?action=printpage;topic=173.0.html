				I have added experience levels to the script. For every kill you earn 20 experience points. When you have reached the points needed, you will move to the next level.<br /><br />Everyone starts from level one, so it doesn&#039;t matter if you haven&#039;t played a lot before.<br /><br />Team kills don&#039;t count, so don&#039;t get any ideas... ;)<br /><br />The new script will be activated soon.<br />

				1.It would be more good if players get something special on specific levels.<br />As for example if you reach to level 10 then you will get access to wear special hat or any outfit.More levels = better stuff.<br />2.Or you could put names on a specific level if you reach there.<br />For example military,<br />Level 10= little soldier<br />Level20=soldier<br />Seargent,General,major,etc.<br />Or any other profession.<br />3.Or you could add specific weapons and equipments at each specific level.

				Seems interesting, maybe make it so that for each teamkill you loose 20 experience points.<br /><br />@EleCtroN<br /><br />Better weapons and equipment on higher levels would make it unfair to newer players later on. Plus it would remove the actual need for the rest of the Fun script if you can freely choose your weapon each round...<br /><br />&nbsp;Yet I agree that &quot;special&quot; hats for higher levels would be pretty nice. Something for those who think they need some sort of bragging rights/just want to be different from the rest.

				Hmm, yes, it might be good to give some reward to higher levels. Perhaps the berets could be used for that?<br /><br />Losing points for team kills? Perhaps. I&#039;ll think about it.

				Camper, if you are going to have a free moment to read my proposal. I&#039;d like that would be on the server for the level of giving gifts. For example as I see it. From level 30 can be used to add a player to this new color in the chat that he was different then from level 40 to add make some kind of hat. But with something like 50 funny sounds. I think it&#039;s a good idea, and many like it. <br />P.S if somebody have any idea or offers about it write /. Thx for attantion

I&#039;d like that would be on the server for the level of giving gifts. For example as I see it. From level 30 can be used to add a player to this new color in the chat that he was different then from level 40 to add make some kind of hat. But with something like 50 funny sounds. I think it&#039;s a good idea, and many like it. <br />P.S if somebody have any idea or offers about it write /. Thx for attantion<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />yes its great idea :D

				Exchange levels against additional hp/speed/&lt;insert idea&gt; for the next 10/30/60/&lt;...&gt; minutes of playtime/&lt;insert&gt; amount of rounds. <br />Example: <br />1.) Afplebot is level 10;<br />2.) Opens menu. hp-boost:+10 hp for 30 minutes: costs: 5 levels;<br />3.) Afplebot buys hp-boost.<br />4.) Afplebot is now level 5 and has 110 hp at round beginning for the next 30 mintues of playtime.<br /><br />That would be great. Feels like I&#039;ve already posted that before, sorry if I did.<br />

				If it&#039;s temporary then I guess it could work, although it&#039;s still kind of unfair. Also it should have a cooldown or something to prevent you from buying several at a time. There are some people who could afford to boost themselves to 250 HP instantly.

				It wont work. I will play 10 rounds and i will get 5th level. Experience which you need to next level is growing with every level you get. It should take your experience instead of levels.
