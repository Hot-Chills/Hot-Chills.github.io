				I didnt expect you were that young. Your english is going well for that age since it isnt your arterial language(mother tongue/native language). A small tip, never lose the interest in learning languages, they&#039;ll get you far one day (especially english). When i was younger, about your age (like 13 years ago) i wasnt even half way skilled in talking or even writing english. O.o this may happened due to the german schoolsystem(we didnt learn other languages this early) nvm. The only words i knew i had picked up from games or movies etc. So one little question, do you learn english in school already?

				@Xoot : Yes, I do learn English in the school, the school itself is one of the best in my city, so that&#039;s one of the reasons why my English is good but when I started playing CS2D and met people older than me who knew better English, I made some friends are and as i always had to talk to them in English so i got used to it. I always learn a new word everyday in games or online with other players! So that are basically the reasons why i am good in English, I am still not perfect though! :D
