				Well just like the topic says I&#039;m having a flash of ideas (suggestions) for Happy to add (if possible) to the server and I hope they are.<br />PS: I probably should&#039;ve started this topic in the mod&#039;s corner but I also like to see the answer of non-mods to this.<br /><br />1) Can you add the speed check command to the mods list of tools in which a mod can check the speed of a player to see if he&#039;s actually a speeder or not.<br /><br />2) Can you add a command that can calculate the accuracy of a player&#039;s shots (for example taking the average accuracy of the last 15 shots he shot in which we can determine if a player is an aimbot or not.<br /><br />I do have more but for now I&#039;ll just wait to see the answer for these two suggestions.<br />Thanks for reading!

				I don&#039;t think that speed checking is quite possible and I don&#039;t know about the aiming but I remember there was a script like that in an old server.<br />Oh and let me post my own suggestion while I am at it (I actually already made a post about it but I suppose It is forgotten):<br />!slap command.<br />

				Actually I had the opposite way of thinking I have seen the speed check thing in a server before I wasnt actually sure about the shot-accuracy thing because it seems to be quite different though i think both suggestions are possible in the end.<br /><br />Btw about the slap, don&#039;t we already have a command like that?

				No, not in text.<br />And in 1/3 of rounds, players are given speed (like flamethrower+speed or chainsaw + speed) so it wont really be that functional.<br />About the aiming thingy; people with great aim would seem guilty for nothing and aimhackers dont use their hacks too much they are not stupid.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				So why dont you use menus? :O<br /><br />Oh well a good mod wouldn&#039;t just have a speed menu saying like 9 for example is a speedhack and he would ban him, he would check a hacker and check another player if they both had a good difference in speed he will ban then.<br />This command is useful when the mod doesn&#039;t want to die to spec a hacker he can check a hacker while being alive and playing.

				It wouldnt be clear, there are a lot of speed rounds and it should be obvious if a player is speedhacking in normal rounds.<br />And you can always go to spectator and watch suspicious people without dying.<br /><br />Oh and you mentioned comparing players speed, what if other one dies quicker?<br />We dont need luas to catch hacker, we need active mods.

				The idea of checking speed is good. It should be made. Elfing probably doesnt get how should it work trolololo<br />So listen dude. YOu have option identify and another one identify speed (it would be the new one) So, you see dude speed 0 so he doesnt hack, another one has for example +10 speed and you know he hack. You dont need tyo check them during rounds with bonus speed, use brain dude

				You can see if they are speedhacking without such thing -_- <br />We came so far without something like that and server isnt filled with speedhackers ^^<br /><br />And i am not sure if its even possible, if it is .... well yeah it wont hurt anyone, I AM supporting this but I dont think its really neccesary

				Dude, its cool that your eyes works fine but we got guyz like ezel who are useless and rest of stuff who arent sure. I get you, i can see hackers without this tool too. But it would be really good for new players / jmods who are without experience

				Good ideas. I have tried implementing a speed detector, but it&#039;s difficult to make one that works for all occasions. Shot accuracy checker might catch really good players. I think using your eyes is the best method.<br /><br />The !slap command is implemented. It will be activated next time the server restarts.

				I don&#039;t know if this already exists but an ignore command for all players would be nice, there are some people that spam through PMs and we can&#039;t mute those because they can&#039;t prove it, I think I have seen it at a [LSD] server.

				You mean ignore PMs only? That should be easy. I&#039;m not sure how it usually works. Does the ignored player get some feedback that he is ignored when trying to PM?

				Is it enough if the player is ignored only until he re-joins the server? If the ignore should be persistent, there should be commands for listing and removing ignores, which makes it more complicated.

				I think it would be better if its persistent but if it&#039;s that hard then make it temporary.
