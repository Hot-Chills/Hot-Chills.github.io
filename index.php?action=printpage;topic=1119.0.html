				Hi guys and female associates.<br /><br />Apparently HNF a.k.a a cheater posted on my channel a message that got myself and him into a discussion.<br /><br />The result of that discussion was the permanent elimination of his hacking tutorials and vids and also the deletion of his channel.<br /><br />I probably didn&#039;t do shit and he was probably already thinking of deleting the channel but still, I triggered that.<br /><br />Anyways I just wanted to inform you that even tho i ain&#039;t doing shit at the server, I still make cs2d better in a general way.<br /><br />Ps: apparently aswell, HNF will speak to DC to develop anti-hacks, lets see if we can trust this (ex?)hacker.<br /><br />Also about sperm cannon, he is fixing some of the broken hacks that are avaiable on youtube so yeah...he&#039;s back, beware!<br /><br />Cheers siN<br /><br />EDIT: Deleting your channel = Deleting your comments on youtube.

				How did EmptySpermCannon (mocking an epic hax0r, im a rebel) know that siN mentioned him in THIS forum?<br /><br />Gentlemen... We have a spy.
