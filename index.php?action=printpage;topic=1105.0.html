				Hello everyone,<br /><br />my nickname is ~Lèµmª§~, USGN-ID is 82845.<br />I am playing CS2D since 2011 and would like to become a moderator on HC//Fun. Even though I am studying right now I still find the time to play CS2D. Most of the time on HC//Fun. A friend of mine suggested me to apply for being a mod, so this application is dedicated to Maloo.<br /><br />So far I have not made any experience as a mod, but being a serious guy I know what I am allowed to do and what not.<br /><br />Have a great evening,<br />~Lèµmª§~
