				Hi,<br /><br />For those of you (which probably includes 98% of everyone reading this) that don&#039;t know me, I was previously the host and leader of [LaG] clan which originally hosted the very popular Fun Server at the time.<br />I played a few rounds here and there and it certainly has that original &#039;Fun&#039; feel to it while having lots of new and cool features that make it all the more interesting.<br />I&#039;m aware that this is entirely remade and I&#039;m impressed, I know there are a lot of similar script remakes but you&#039;ve expanded into something a lot more standalone than it was.<br /><br />To tell you the truth, any remake on unreal.de and especially your&#039;s is hundreds of times better than the original Fun Script.<br />It originated when a vice leader was messing around teleporting people into random areas and just equiping weapons and stuff. To make it less of a hassle we decided to just make a script that does that automatically and who knew it&#039;d become one of the most popular gamemodes in CS2D. The code is just messily smashed together and horribly optimized with &#039;as long as it works&#039; in mind.<br /><br />Maybe someday I&#039;ll release the original script, and you can be disappointed at how awful it was yet so highly prized.<br /><br />Just some history that I never found the chance to share with everyone.<br /><br />Regards.

				Hi Cortez,<br /><br />Thanks a lot for sharing the history behind the original script. [LaG] Fun was one of my favourite servers back in the days. I spent too many hours there, just playing &quot;another round&quot;. It was such an addictive mod!<br /><br />I was truly sad when you decided to close down everything. REWARDS picked up the script, but it soon closed as well. That&#039;s when I decided to write my own remake. I tried to keep most of the original rounds, as far as my memory allowed me. After that new rounds have been added. The intention is still to keep the original feel, while adding new rounds when new weapons become available.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad you decided to pop in. You are always welcome here.<br /><br />-Häppy

				Glad you feel that way.<br /><br />On a quick side note, we never had any sort of &#039;rounds&#039; system.<br />It was just a randomizer picking weapons out of lists within smaller &#039;gamemodes&#039; (&#039;portal&#039;; &#039;dodgeball&#039;; &#039;construction&#039;; &#039;standard&#039;)<br /><br />If you&#039;re truly interested I can pm you the original script if you think you missed anything, though I think you&#039;ve already got the just of things, just let me know.
