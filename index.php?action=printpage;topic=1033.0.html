				Hello. I came here because I want become someone who&#039;s able to ban cheaters. A few minutes ago I saw on the server a guy who&#039;s using speedhack (link to video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0r2E9HBvzg)) and after this I finally decided to make an apply.<br /><br />So yeah. My name is Ernest and I&#039;m 19 years old. I play in this game since 2009 and I can&#039;t stop it :ugly:. To be honest I&#039;m not very active on this server because I&#039;m competitive player and I prefer 5on5 matches/mixes. Just sometimes I like to play a few times a day for 15 minutes. I hope that&#039;s enought to get some rights. I have huge experience as a moderator, let me mention where I was or I&#039;m an admin: Rewards | Construction, PCS Project, The Anal Bagels and [LSD]. Why exactly I want to be a Mod/SMod? I hate cheaters, no more to say. Ohh my Unreal Software ID 14545.<br /><br />If you have any questions about me, feel free to ask))

				3° things...<br />1-What&#039;s your recording program? :o<br />2-To continue being a mod you need at least 3hours each 14days, i recommend you to read all the topics posted by forum mods in category &quot;Mod applications&quot;<br />3-I won&#039;t vote yet, neutral.

				Hi, Hajt. <br />You&#039;re a nice and skilled player, active member of the PCS Project and USGN community.<br />As you mentioned before, you prefer professional matches and mixes, which is fine.<br />The thing is, Moderating a Fun Server requires some time and dedication.. :/ <br />I understand that hackers annoy players and everyone would be glad to get rid of them, but this is what we are trying to do. We want to promote people that would spend a decent amount of time on the server and watch the situation. You never know when something might go wrong, or when will hackers join, that is why i spend 1-2 hours just spectating players and chatting with them. <br />I&#039;m always glad to see good players on the server, and if you will become more active i might change my opinion.<br />But currently i&#039;m neutral.<br />Anyways, good luck!

				Hi Hajt! It&#039;s me, clonez here! I&#039;m definitely voting this skilled dude a yes. Yes, he could be not active as much as other moderators, but it doesn&#039;t mean he is totally inactive at all. He mentioned above &quot;a few times a day for 15 minutes&quot; which could be seen in many different ways. He could be joining 6 times in a day and 15mins/join ? That&#039;ll be sufficient enough for a week. Anyways, good luck mate!

				Well. First of all thanks for your comments. I was thinking how much hours I&#039;m able to spend by playing on the server per day. At the moment I can say that 1 hour 30 minutes. It won&#039;t be a big problem for me I suppose. Anyways I&#039;ll try to be more active in weekends of course.<br /><br />By the way. I want to say something more about me. I love programming, mainly in PHP. I like creating something out of nothing. My latest project is available on this page (http://cs2d.net/workshop/table.php), it&#039;s tournament table for ICC v9. I host well-known (at least for competitive players) server. I did a few tournaments for this game and I&#039;m gonna do more in the future. This can be a little bit funny but I love support this game in any way. I&#039;m doing it since years by helping people, writing scripts, doing streams and many other things. It&#039;s somehow gives me great joy.

				Greetings Hajt,<br /><br />You get a positive. Even if he isn&#039;t such active, he is one of the persons in cs:2d who I think, are able to moderate a community and server with fairness and as a reliable and mature person.<br /><br />Cheers
