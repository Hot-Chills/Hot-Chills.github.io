				I&#039;ve come here to ask, why have i been banned in this server? Well i&#039;m not quite sure, whats the real reason, but i know that ip check can find out the reason and if it will be Cheating/Hacking i can sincerely say i&#039;m not an hacker. I have played tournament matches (in PCS Community) and we use anticheat there so ya. IP will be shared only via PM.<br /><br /><br />Cheers.

				Going to confirm your supposed identity with the other PCS members.<br /><br />EDIT: I&#039;ve confirmed with an old &amp; trustful PCS player (S!im) and Guardian doesn&#039;t use hacks, I believe this is a missunderstanding. Guardian we should wait for whoever that banned you gives an explanation.

				I don&#039;t know you, and i have no idea who banned you.<br />I went to your profile and saw your USGN ID, which was 144904.<br />Then i went to UnrealSoftware to check, but it said that a user with this ID doesn&#039;t exist.<br />Why is it so?

				Be more attentive :p<br />Do you remember what did it say when you got banned? <br />And where are you from? I&#039;m asking because distant countries are known to have high ping, causing a player to move like a speedhacker. Maybe someone thought you were speeding.

				The ban was done almost two years ago by Bounty Hunter, but I doubt he remembers it. It&#039;s an IP ban and the reason was &quot;Hacking/Cheating&quot;. The U.S.G.N., which is different from your current one, was banned 10 minutes before the IP address for the same reason. The U.S.G.N. is banned at Unreal Software as well, since three months ago.<br /><br />An interesting thing is that the player used the nick &quot;next generation of aimbot&quot; when he was banned.<br /><br />Did you have another U.S.G.N. before your current one?
