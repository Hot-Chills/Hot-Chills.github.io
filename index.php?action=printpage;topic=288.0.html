				I think we have to create new Ideas , so that we will get new players .<br />For a while we had always at least 22 Players in the Server , now we have a maximum of 15 players.<br />So in my oppinion we need new Ideas , new Game mods , so that the server is going to be again popular as he was.

				I am aware that the number of players has dropped during the last few months. I see two reasons for this.<br /><br />1. The IP address has changed twice. Each time, the number of players plunged immediately and then recovered slowly.<br /><br />2. People are busy with schools now. It&#039;s the same every year.<br /><br />Right now I&#039;m not in the mood to do anything radical with the server. I am pretty sure there will be more players when we get closer to Christmas break. So hang in there, it will get better.

				I know that I&#039;m repeating myself, and that is already tired. But I want to decide something about the topic with the levels. Just turns out that they are generally useless. And so it is possible to add something like starting from level 50 and continue to plus 10. something to add (any surprises or sweets)

				You are too impatient. Christmas is still 10-11 days away. The map will come on a few days before Christmas.<br /><br />I&#039;ll see what I can do about the website. It&#039;s a nice idea to have some Christmas decorations here as well. Good suggestion.
