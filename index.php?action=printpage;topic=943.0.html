				Aloha, guys!<br />Last week, i saw speedhacker and i kick him. But, he go to the server again with another name (from Player 3 to Player). Then, i speclock him. He gone. After 5min, he go to server again. Now his name is Player 2, without USGN. Another, much player have name like me (Player F2 = Player F1 or F3, or sometimes same, Player F2). He just kid, not pro too. My reputation&#039;s down. I kick him, he go to server again. I&#039;m sad and angry. He broke my reputation&#039;s.<br />Ahah,<br />My reason to apply for Mod or SMod is to ban/tban or perm ban to all hacker or insulter. I think i&#039;m active player. 5-6hours in 14day and 10-15hours in 30days (cause i play 3-6 hours in weekend&nbsp; :D).<br /><br />Just that for now. I think, i was lucky be jmod in this international server (i think), but is not good enough cause cant ban any player who brokes the rules. Then, I will follow the moderator&#039;s rules and didn&#039;t abuse.<br />Sorry for bad english (cause asian). I hope all of you read it and my application response faster...<br /><br />Regards, Player F2/ Youtubes

				Youre a nice guy, but i think 3-6 hours a week is to short. This time i play often in 2 days. So maybe could be more active. As Mod you cannot ban if i am right and for smod youre rank time as jmod is too short to get smod now.<br /><br />Your first application:<br />http://hotchills.org/index.php/topic,926.0.html (http://hotchills.org/index.php/topic,926.0.html)

				Im neutral about your promotion..<br />Btw. Daenerys, it doesnt matter if he plays 3-6hours&nbsp; or 20hours a week. It depends on the spare time he has to offer. Some people just got a real life beside their gaming one.

				Thats my opinion xoot. I am not interested at the life of you or him. Also you can give a user, wgich play 1 hours a week, moderator but if he deserve it for the time which he is on server is probaly false.

				Thats totally wrong. When he&#039;s still active (3-6h a week, which is enough, not the best but enough) there&#039;s no reason to judge anything related to his activity. You cant force ppl to spend more time in games as they&#039;re used to bring fun. Nevermind, it would be better to say something about his moderation skills instead, because i never noticed nor saw him when i was playing so its hard for me to judge about this promotionrequest.
