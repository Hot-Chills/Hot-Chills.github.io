				And its our administrators foult. They dont know to who they give powers! Tuborg abusing his powers, instead of warn and later mute, he just kicks. Where is point of this if he comes back with double rage? Tuborg is one of this players who gonna abuse his permissions. God damn nonsense, i predict you BIG APOCALYPSE soon! There will to many (searching world with same meaning but not that offesnive like retarded) dudes! Beware, just beware.

				I am with Bonzo. Those mods doesnt change anything. Nobody here can ban hackers and comunity on server doesnt need to be inproved. I dont want to be arrogant but nobody else (maybe one or 2 mods) here dont improve playing as i do. I am the only one who want to ban real hackers, I would do it by myself but i cant. Rest mods are like &quot;dont flame&quot; &quot;dont camp&quot; but who need them? If players want to kick sombody they can use vote kick.

				I played few times with Tuborg in stealth mode and I found out he loves to threaten players with his powers... Ex : Camping...Kick OR BAN!!!<br />I think &quot;newbies&quot; such as TheWeek &amp; Tuborg need some experiences before having responsibilities.They both often speak their motherlanguage rather than English so their English understanding is bad...<br />If I did hurt anyone , sorry it is just my opinion.
