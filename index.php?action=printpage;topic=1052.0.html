				I don&#039;t support your application because today was the first time since a long time that I&#039;ve seen you on this server. I am not even sure whether I&#039;ve met you before anywhen on it. Nobody is interested what your parents are doing, I would suggest you also that it isn&#039;t that good if you tell any guys who you don&#039;t know in the internet, information like this ???

				Mew, you think that one time when you&#039;ve played should be enough to get a Moderator rank? Seriously not, futhermore I don&#039;t use this nickname that often, yesterday I&#039;ve played as Player and Surpreme&nbsp; :o<br />Finally, you should rate your english skills honestly, because it&#039;s easy to get that yours aren&#039;t 7/10. You only have to read this and know that they aren&#039;t even better than mine, and my english skills are maximal 6/10. I also learned english since I&#039;m 6 years old, but it is english that you learn in school, you can&#039;t expect that much of it.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">1- Name &lt; In Game &gt; :<br />2- Age :<br />3- Country :<br />4- Why Do You To Be Vip/Mod ? :<br />5- Do You Have Any Mod Experience &lt; In Other Servers &gt; ? :<br />6- When Did You Start To Play Cs2d ? :<br />7- How Many Hours You Can Online ? :<br />8- USGN Name :<br />9- USGN ID :</code><br /><strong>source: his internet forum, link in his profil</strong><br /><br /><br /><br />Cheers
