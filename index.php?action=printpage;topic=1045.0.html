				Hi, I played your server and saw a abusive moderator so I came to report him here.<br /><br />Here is the story, I joined the server and played a bit, we reached the construction part and the moderator told us to not camp so I was about to go out of CT base but then someone shoot at me so I had to go back or else I&#039;ll die, then a mass spam of slaps hit me and I got killed.<br />I would like to add that the terrorist side was camping too and also ONLY I from my team got killed.<br /><br />Then I told the moderator my side but he didn&#039;t listen and he muted me, afterword&#039;s I left and reconnected and spectated while reporting and got free-kicked for the reason: &quot;what the fuck?&quot;<br /><br />If this is not abusive I don&#039;t know what is.<br /><br />Also while I was battling him he slapped me for clearly no reason.<br />I Require demotion or a temp punishment.<br /><br />Also I would like to add my name was crash as a joke and if no one noticed I didn&#039;t crash shit.<br /><br />Screenshots below.<br />http://www.mediafire.com/view/dywh8j08v1bx3zz/wat.PNG#<br />http://www.mediafire.com/view/j9p21wv3w9dvvv9/dm_dust_00000.jpg#<br />http://www.mediafire.com/view/0qob4hvdlcul3bn/menu_00000.jpg#<br />http://www.mediafire.com/view/x8ut6mxltr4lglm/menu_00001.jpg#<br />http://www.mediafire.com/view/4b5btnb8dixbd86/menu_00002.jpg#

				hi, if you did not like the way i punished you for camping you could have just said, i like to play with people when they break a rule, i do the same with hackers, anyways if you did not like or if i offended you in any other way I apologize.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: *also i find it suspicious that after you putted that &quot;crash&quot; name the server lagged as hell and crashed*<br /><br />RE-EDIT: *&quot;what the fuck&quot; your character was literally INSIDE a wall, everytime the round restarted you were still there, i should have given a proper explanation but i was surprised to see that bug, sorry, also i only saw you and another ct camping so...yeah*

				I could not ban you because when the server crashed I crashed too, also i thought that i could be wrong so even if you joined the server after i wasn&#039;t going to ban you until i was 100% sure.<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: *do you accept my apologies or do we need to extend this conversation?*

				Almost everyone in the construction round &quot;camps&quot; &gt;.&gt;<br />But if you&#039;re upraging a supply or you&#039;re waiting for your mates to fully equip themselves, that&#039;s fine, as long as you don&#039;t sit in one place and do nothing. <br />siN was allowed to slap (a few times, only to warn), but i don&#039;t think killing a player by slapping is appropriate..<br />Try to warn players without immediate actions, if that doens&#039;t work you can slap/mute/kick etc. <br />You&#039;re doing a good job, just don&#039;t be a tyrant, siN :/
