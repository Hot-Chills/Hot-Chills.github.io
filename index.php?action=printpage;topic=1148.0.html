				Title: <strong>HC =&gt; Fws</strong><br />

				After discussions with Fws we have decided to let Fws take over HC // Fun. It was a difficult decision for me since the server has been around for five years now. The shrinking HC community and my lack of time finally tipped the scale.<br /><br />My hope is that HC // Fun will live on under its new name -[|Fws|]- HC // Fun and attract more players since it will be integrated into the bigger Fws community.<br /><br />All pinned levels have been removed. Moderators and admins will have to re-apply at the Fws forum (http://fws.boards.net/).<br /><br />I want to thank everyone who has visited the server or the forum. A special thanks to the people that have volunteered as admins and moderators, helping new players and punishing cheaters. Without you this had not been possible!

				As the current leader of FWS I want to clear some things for the regular players and the members of this forum:<br /><br />We won&#039;t do any gameplay changes to HC // Fun unless necessary (to fix bugs etc.)<br />We&#039;ll adequately moderate it and manage it.<br />Our forum will be the new place for applications and discussion for the server.( fws.boards.net )<br />HC // Fun will remain exactly as it is, just under FWS moderation and management.<br /><br />And for the moderators who got removed, I bet it feels sucky to be removed suddenly but don&#039;t be afraid, our staff applications are currently open and we would gladly take the best of you in and grant you the pride of being a FWS moderator.<br />Thanks for your understanding, if you have any questions, you may contact me from the forums (http://fws.boards.net/conversation/new/2) or from our discord (http://discord.gg/BpgVVRJ).

				I am grateful as well, I kept on visiting this forum in hope that the server would get revived but unfortunately such thing did not happen, so for me to see that HC Fun will be integrated in Fws is just amazing :)<br /><br />I do have two questions (directed to Happy Camper more specifically):<br /><br />1- What will happen to this forum? (If it gets closer, can you add a redirect to the fws forum or thread that clears why the forum got deleted?)<br /><br />2- What will happen to Happy Camper?<br />Are you going to quit cs2d?

				I feel sad that HC isn&#039;t the same anymore. But i guess this was necessary for its revival. Being the administrator of this community for over 4 years is very special to me. Btw, i have no clue about what&#039;s happening in the game. As i should mention, i had both positive and negative views about FWS. (maybe cuz of some douchebags who got kicked from FWS anyway) <br />But anyways, its a new start and i feel it&#039;s necessary maybe because i am equally responsible for this situation. I know FWS is in the right hands right now. Elfing, Nighthawk, etc were definitely one of the best moderators here. It was pleasure to have a wonderful moderators like you all here. <br />And Elfing, try to keep it easy for the former HC moderators who deserve it. You have seen them all. (I do know how you are.. and you won&#039;t let me down. Haha ) <br />Also, i am not so sure about myself if i&#039;ll be joining back or not. But i would like to request that ŦƲƦƙɘƳ should also be the part of the new admin team. He&#039;s the most deserving one for that position from our team. <br />

				I will definitely miss this forum and community. I&#039;m glad I met you people, HC//Fun was truly the beginning of my CS2D experience and I&#039;m glad I was a part of it.<br /><br />Thank you HC for an amazing gameplay experience. Your coding skills are amazing by the way. And a huge thanks to the administrators for bearing with me when I was a nub back in the day. (:
