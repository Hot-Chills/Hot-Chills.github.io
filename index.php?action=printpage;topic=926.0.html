				1) USGN ID : 130888<br />&nbsp;<br />2) In-game name: Player F2<br /><br />3) How active you can/will be: I can be active 1-3 hours per day or can be 4h in weekend<br /><br />4) Have you had any prior experience as a moderator? Yes. I had moderator experience in old asian server, but i forget the server name. In that server, i always kick hacker. If he go in that server and hack again, i temporary ban him (sometime permanent ban). And i always change bad/racist name who play in that server.<br /><br />5) Why exactly do you want to be a Mod/SMod ?<br />I want to be Mod or SMod because of two reasons.<br />First one is I have long time played on HC Fun server. First time i play on that server, i think this is good server to play ,and I played everyday on it.Peoples are very friendly on it. I had long dreamed to be Mod or SMod in this server, but just now I am making an application. Of first time i join it that is my dream.So I wait some time and make apply for Mod. I am active on HC Fun, of my 1/3 time on cs2d i spend playing HC Fun for me that is best server i ever played on (I think). Also it&#039;s very popular server. Also script on server suprised me.<br />Second reason because i want to kick or ban hacker every i see them. Popular server like HC Fun server certainly many hacker entered. For that, I will make the hacker deterrent with kick or ban him.<br /><br />6) *OPTIONAL* I am a guy who loves pop music. My headset is always close to me. I played counter strike 2D since 2009. I am pro in portal gun with mine or lasermine mode in HC. I live in Singapore. I have 18years old. I don&#039;t like chili or some hot foods. That is all for now. More about me, you can tell me everytime...<br /><br />Thank you for read my application and sorry for bad english :D !!

				positive<br /><br /><del>neutral<br /><br />i know the hc// server needs new active JMODs but ....<br /><br />i know Player F2, he is an active player. i like him ingame, but thats isnt a good application. a time window of 1-3 hours is very big.<br />also. who has a dream to become JMOD on hc//fun?? it is a hobby, a game, but no dream.<br /><br />if you modify your application my vote will be positive. but more details also in this </del><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">4) Have you had any prior experience as a moderator?
