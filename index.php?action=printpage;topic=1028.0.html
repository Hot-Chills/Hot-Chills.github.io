				I&#039;m not familiar with you and I don&#039;t think you should apply that fast for a Mod imo. No offense, I applied mine 5 months later to be exact. But since you&#039;re making an effort and contribute well to the community, its a yes from me. Good luck mate!

				Yeah, we still don&#039;t have many (or enough) moderators, so accepted as Mod. I&#039;m away from my pc this weekend and I will be thankful if anyone else promote this guy.

				Mate, even hackers are only humans. I only know one who is such annoying that he keeps joining and that is Sperm Cannon. Futhermore I change my vote now to Negative, also if my explanation might not convince you from my opinion. I think that you aren&#039;t ready to become a Moderator because even the simplest task seems to much or I did delude that it was you? I think not, your way isn&#039;t like it should be for a Moderator.<br /><br />I am V.I.P. on C# Sparta which is currently a well visited server and has a lot of hackers who wants to destroy the game play, I do my job and kill them again and again till they give finally up (<em>only Sperm Cannon didn&#039;t</em>). So they get mad and easily use my name, so that genios like you think that <strong>I am</strong> hacking. That&#039;s sure the reason why you are <em>changing</em> my name.<br /><strong>The HELL, what should it be usefull that you change the hackers name?? Mate, what&#039;s up?</strong> Like you see here in the Screenshot, I am Speactor and I am *dead*, so if I want to change my name, it gets written that my name change will be done after respawn. So any Mod had to do this.<br />(http://img5.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/unbenanntmvkybzhnwd.png) (http://www.fotos-hochladen.net)<br /><br />So why it should be usefull that you change a hackers name? A Kick would be reasonable, a Ban would be reasonable, but not this. However you haven&#039;t even checked my datas whether I am the user who I want to be, and that&#039;s the reason why I think that you should not be a Mod. It is your duty to check the datas and firstly report them here that he gets permantly banned <strong>and</strong> that you <strong>are</strong> sure that the person is the same guy who hacked before, because I was in spec mode and you can&#039;t know whether I have any hacks opened when I am not even playing.<br />Think that you have ban rights and ban a player without doing the first points which I wrote above. That isn&#039;t justifiable in my point of view. And than after I asked you what you are doing, you only wrote <em>piwi isn&#039;t piwi, he&#039;s fake, you are fake</em>, even than you have not checked who I am and even a Player said that I am the real what you can easily see because my usgn id is easily to remember than nearly every other usgn id, and this usgn id is unique! Here&#039;s again the &quot;proof&quot; that he&#039;s the player, same usgn id.<br />(http://img5.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/abusey4ec7vrn6i.png) (http://www.fotos-hochladen.net)<br /><br />I am sorry that I can&#039;t add any logs to this situation, because my log recording haven&#039;t worked, but this JMod did this twice without any reason and you can check the logs of server if you want, the time is written below.<br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font">Don&#039;t get my wrong, it is only a name change, but from my point of view this action wasn&#039;t right and if these steps aren&#039;t the standard method before punishing any player without that he haven&#039;t done anything before.</span><br /><br /><em>the circa Time was: 17:15 UTC+1</em><br /><br />P.S. Most of you talking that we have too less active Moderators on HC// Fun, it is the truth but I would suggest that anyone add a server message which notice the&nbsp; players that Moderator Appliactions are opened<br /><br />P.P.S. Sorry for eventuelly mistakes in grammar or vocabulary, I wrote it as fast as I can because I don&#039;t really want to do this right now ._________.

				You didn&#039;t have to quote me the whole world, i simple and nice explanation would be good, anyways I&#039;m already a mod and I&#039;m already banning hackers, if you think they should be warned then my friend you are the one who needs to lose his mod, hackers ruin the game and must be punished without further consequences.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />(Also i thought you were a mod in HC // Fun so i thought you were faking yourself (mindblowing D:) anyways i admit my mistake and i apologize.

				@CrazyF.M., I don&#039;t quote anything, I only tell everyone the reason why I am against it instead of only saying that I am against it without any explanation. I realized that you already got promoted, someone was fast this time. However the point isn&#039;t that you should apologize for anything, the point is that I don&#039;t like your method when you want to punish someone. Futhermore you haven&#039;t read my complex text, so I am kind disappointed that you don&#039;t answer to more of my points. I haven&#039;t said that you should warn them, you should check whether they hack and then ban, or check them and take care whether they are the hackers who you have watched before.<br />The middle part, I don&#039;t get it what you want to say... why I should get demoted?<br /><br />P.S.: And what how you checked that I am <strong>not</strong> Mod? Only trying to punish me and you will see whether it works?

				After crying like a kid, this is one of the badest solutions of acting mate, what are you doing? Like I <strong>wrote</strong>, you have <strong>not</strong> checked my identity like you are trying to tell me now, if you have done, you haven&#039;t even punished me or you are easily dumb? But that isnt what I am thinking, I only want that you read what I said. And by jugding your answers, you haven&#039;t done completly.

				PiWi, this is not a place to start such a conversation, you&#039;d better talk on pm. What about Crazy, well, nobody was born with moderating skills, so PiWi you&#039;d better guide him and advice without starting conflict. Crazy will learn, everyone need some time. Topic locked.
