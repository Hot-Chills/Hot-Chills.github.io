				Normal players are given VIP statuses after playing for 2 hours, this will be a bad idea as only moderators should be able to access a user&#039;s information which he may want to keep private. The VIP system on HC//Fun is quite different from other servers, mind.

				I agree with Nighthawk. Why do you think it&#039;s needed?

				If I may share my opinion.<br /><br />I agree so called VIPs shouldn&#039;t have access to ones IP address, but I also think some active players should. They could actively help.<br /><br />A few hours ago I was in the latter category and eventhough I tried to note down cheaters, without their USGNs I couldn&#039;t really help. (Right Electron?)<br /><br />So my proposal is to make a new user group that could be handed out more freely to those who are eager to help.<br /><br />Perhaps rename VIP status to &quot;Server Regular&quot; and create new VIP for the above mentioned category. (Simply because the term VIP suggest its above Server Regular)<br /><br />So players who play 2 hours would be Server Regulars (or Regulars) and a little more advanced group would be the VIP, which would be given out by admins (perhaps based on the suggestion of mods) and they would have a few more privilige compared to regulars (including the access to USGNs).<br /><br />

				Thanks for your opinion, AREIOS. V.I.P.s can report players. The U.S.G.N. and IP are logged and can be read by admins. So it&#039;s there already. I don&#039;t know if people know about it, though.

				I personally saw the command and I think I even used it once or twice but there was no feedback so I didn&#039;t know if its useful or not.<br /><br />Maybe an information banner every 2 min would help. Saying: &quot;Use the report function for xy&quot;<br />But then again, if nearly every player have this command, the reports could be spammed and there would be no way to verify the quality.

				I would not like to be more user groups. There would be a mess in server like on Starkkz admin script.
