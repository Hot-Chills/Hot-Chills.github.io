				A bunch of DaNgEr people come to this server, and they suck and are generally immature and act like dicks, so I sometimes fake them by taking their names while they are on the server, just to make some fun of them.<br /><br />Right now, I faked one of them, and a Mod named &quot;Z&quot; kept changing my name, and eventually muted me for one day.<br /><br />There is no rule on faking names, and also, Danger simply sucks and they are a bunch of immature kids. So, Z pretty much abused his powers and just said that he is angry today.<br /><br />GG.

				Man, it&#039;s ridiculous. If you faked, you&#039;ve got what you worth. Besides, I&#039;m taking care of my guys. We have rules, too. If someone insulted you or spammed just report to us in dangers.createaforum.com (http://dangers.createaforum.com)
