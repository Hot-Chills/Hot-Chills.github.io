				Reported user: Albss (also known as Ra)<br />Report date: October 30th, 2015 (according to my timezone)<br />Report reason: Power abusing<br />Proof: http://imgur.com/a/lsegy<br /><br />Just to say in advance, I&#039;m not 100% sure whether this person is a mod or not, but since I was kicked after he said &quot;so you are punished by your user&quot;, I can only think that it was him who did it. Or maybe the mod was his friend (I&#039;m assuming bro was his friend), not sure...<br /><br />And well, I called him a &quot;dick&quot; because I was talking to him politely (probably he didn&#039;t like the way I talked or whatever, still no excuse to start insulting me like that),then he started calling me &quot;gay bot&quot;, &quot;cheating bot&quot; and also told me to &quot;shut up and hear&quot;. Honestly, I know I shouldn&#039;t have insulted back, but he asked for it, after that I got kicked for &quot;Spamming&quot;...<br /><br />And before anyone calls me on it, he started it and if he is really a mod, that&#039;s not how a mod should behave. Just because he is a mod, it doesn&#039;t mean he can say whatever he wants and act like he can tell people to do whatever he wants (yes I know there are the rules, but this was not about them), it&#039;s just childish...

				You did so i was about to do it i too have emotions i am not a dog or a cow to be quiet i too have sixth sense to react all humans have some patience, See if i am a mod is there anything i should be dumb or blind no to see others scolding me or speaking bad about me?? If you react wrong to me??&nbsp; I am also a human who has feelings, Others know me how i am i will be good and kind to good peoples.

				So basically RR was joking around and BCG2000 overreacted?<br />Also, for insulting we use short mutes, not kicks. Calling other people bots and such can and usually will be taken as an insult. Mods should show good behavior, is all I&#039;m saying.

So yes, be friends.

				ŦƲƦƙɘƳ: &quot;[BOT]&quot; was just part of my name, I don&#039;t play exactly like a bot, but I can happen to talk like a bot, it was just that. But you must be kidding me here, he wasn&#039;t joking, the pics clearly show you calling me &quot;gay bot&quot;, &quot;cheating bot&quot; and telling me to &quot;shup up and hear&quot;, you call that joking? It wasn&#039;t a joke, either if it was, he shouldn&#039;t have done it in first place, because it is offensive, calling someone a &quot;gay&quot; is offensive in any way you do it. Also I don&#039;t take being called &quot;bot&quot; as offensive, but &quot;gay bot&quot; obviouly is offensive. And it wasn&#039;t an overreaction either, he wasn&#039;t joking, for me that&#039;s just an excuse to cover up insults, and just to add, I don&#039;t know him, so I&#039;m not his friend either.<br /><br />Range Rover: I got tensioned and called you a &quot;dick&quot; exactly because of what I said above, you insulted me first, it wasn&#039;t for no reason, you were talking disrespectfully to me. Don&#039;t insult people and expect them to not insult back, and especially, don&#039;t use your powers in that case. If I was the one who insulted you first you would be right, but no, in this case it was YOU who insulted me first and then you kicked me because apparently you love to insult others for no reason but hate when they insult you back. You got what you asked for. If you want respect, then respect others too.<br /><br />More to add: That&#039;s everything I have to say. But now don&#039;t bullshit me saying he was joking and that I overreacted, don&#039;t put the blame on me, the pics show who started it and it was him. I understand you don&#039;t want trouble on your server, after all everyone should have fun, but giving a blind eye / excuses to things your mods do won&#039;t help either. Sometimes I ignore people who insult me, sometimes I don&#039;t, I just got enough of it in all the years I have been on the internet, I&#039;m not ironman about anything, but really, as a mod he shouldn&#039;t have done what he did, I myself would never insult anyone for no reason, &quot;joking&quot; or not. Just noticed that he lied too, see EDIT below.<br /><br />Also I won&#039;t be his friend and I ask him to not talk with me for a time, he really gave me a bad impression. But it will be cleared with time, I just won&#039;t act like nothing happened. As for ŦƲƦƙɘƳ, I think this can be closed now, but just don&#039;t bullshit me by giving him a blind eye to this, the proof clearly shows what he did. And again for Range Rover, do better next time, mod status is to keep the game clean, not to mess it up.<br /><br />EDIT: I just noticed this &quot;He acts as a bot i warned him many rounds playing as bot and delaying others time.&quot;, THAT&#039;S A LIE, you never warned me for acting like a bot whatsoever and I didn&#039;t delay the game either, WTF dude? And as I said, I don&#039;t play exactly like a bot, you are just making stuff up to make me look bad here. You see that kicking me for insulting you back because YOU insulted me first was bad, so you just made something else up to excuse your kick, that&#039;s a low move from your part. The owner(s) can check the logs and see that he never warned me for playing like a bot, he didn&#039;t warn me once about that because as I said, I wasn&#039;t playing exactly like a bot, the &quot;[BOT]&quot; was just part of my name. Infact, he didn&#039;t warn me &quot;many rounds&quot;, not even once as I said before, it&#039;s a lie.

				Wow, this truly is interesting. For some reason you, BCG2000, thought that I was on RR&#039;s side or something like that. I did say that mods shouldn&#039;t behave like he did. I&#039;m not covering it up at all. I <strong>thought</strong> that RR didn&#039;t mean the things he said (he&#039;s a mod for long time now and he is pretty trustworthy), but it&#039;s quite apparent now that he&#039;s lying for some reason. At least that&#039;s what you led me to believe, if he actually lied about telling you not to waste anyone&#039;s time (the owner can check the logs, though it&#039;s pretty obvious what&#039;s going on here). However, it doesn&#039;t really matter if he&#039;s lying about that, he still did insult you. RR, you should take notice of how you&#039;re talking with other people. You can&#039;t just insult someone and then expect them to be nice to you. Having certain powers doesn&#039;t mean that you can do whatever the hell you want. BCG2000, this report is meaningful and meaningless at the same time. Sure, good job on reporting a mod for insulting, but now making such a fuss about it? All I can say to you is that you shouldn&#039;t take such things very seriously, but if you want to - fine. There&#039;s a reason why I&#039;m here anyway. I reacted like that earlier because I didn&#039;t take this as seriously as you did and I also thought RR is more trustworthy than he actually is. I hope RR learns his lesson. Thanks for the report.

				I didn&#039;t mean to make a fuss about it, but in my eyes it seemed as you took it like nothing, if that&#039;s not what you meant then I apologize, I didn&#039;t mean to make matters worse. I took it seriously because I was playing my game, and I don&#039;t know him at all and then he said shit to me, pretty much that and then he lied, that&#039;s just asking for more, I hope you didn&#039;t misunderstand what I tried to say. And on a side note, I take power abusing very seriously, even as a normal player. I come on a server to play, not to get stressed by things like this, thus making me waste my time too. And no problem about the report, the logs will show you the truth, and thanks sir. And I hope he learned his lesson as well and that he doesn&#039;t do things like this again, respect and self-control are very important, especially for someone in his position.

				&quot;Where are half of the console messages you edited and deleted it and shown here?? what a star you are. i dont want to argue with cheating persons like you.&quot;<br /><br />Wow, are you kidding me? You are worse than what I thought, you keep trying to excuse yourself and lie more, no offense, but you are bringing more bullshit on this. Now I&#039;m really asking the owner(s) to check the logs and see that I didn&#039;t edit/hide/delete any console message there, and also to show that this mod keeps on lying (saying I was wasting people&#039;s time in-game, that he warned me many rounds about it and now that I&#039;m showing fake proofs, all bullshit from him). You are just making it worse for yourself dude.<br /><br />Oh and if you insist on saying that I play exactly like a bot and that I waste people&#039;s time because of it, here is a video I made 2 days ago showing how I play on the server: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxkVzLbIsq0 , I made this video because the player &quot;Kawaii&quot; kept accusing me of cheating, said he was recording it and that he was gonna report me, apparently he was lying too, the video is a proof that I didn&#039;t cheat, but that&#039;s not the point here. I only put the video here to show that you are lying about how I play, but the owner(s) still need(s) to check the logs to see that the other things you said were lies too.<br /><br />NOTE: The video above is actually separate videos put together, so when one ends it will jump straight to another one, &quot;cutting&quot;, just making this clear, I only put the parts I considered more relevant.<br /><br />

				Why are you twisting what I said? This is only a report about you abusing your powers, this has nothing to do with revenge, I never said that you should be demoted (which is something that is up to the higher level admins and not me) and especially I never said that I should be promoted because of this. I never attacked you in first place, why you think it&#039;s a revenge is beyond me, if it was really a revenge then my report would be much more aggressive toward you, which it was not. If you do shit with your powers, you are obviously gonna get reported sooner or later, deal with it.<br /><br />And the question is what is YOUR problem? You could have simply admited what you did and apologized, accepted your warning/punishment and this would have ended without any problems... But no, you had to make up excuses and lies, the only one making things worse for himself here is you and you only. I know I&#039;m saying the truth and I have no problem saying anything here, the logs of the server will show it.

You wanna put the blame on me while in reality it&#039;s all your fault. You are really making a big deal out of it now, excuses and lies is not the way to go. You are not acting like a mod, you are acting like a child. Now I really think that you shouldn&#039;t have your mod status, but that&#039;s not up to me. People like you just ruin the game instead of making it clean. And it was only a report, but now you really showed me that you shouldn&#039;t be trusted with the power. Probably you did this to other players before, masks don&#039;t stay up forever.<br /><br />Anyways, everything is on the first page of this topic, I will just await the response of the higher level admins.

				Range Rover: For the last time: You said I&#039;m a &quot;gay bot&quot; right after you said that you &quot;love&quot; me for the second time, the insults and the way you talked to me led me to giving you what you asked for there. And when I said that you are being childish or acting like a child, it has to do with your behavior, not your age.<br /><br />Bounty Hunter: No that&#039;s not the best option, that&#039;s the easy option. This topic wouldn&#039;t go so far if he didn&#039;t make excuses up, lies and say I did things that I didn&#039;t really do, you gonna ignore that? I won&#039;t say sorry to him and then act like nothing happened, he is a mod lying, trying to hide what happened, you think that&#039;s nothing? If you let him go on this one, he will do it to others, I know because he refuses to admit what he did. I understand if you trust him, but this is a very serious report and shouldn&#039;t be ignored.<br /><br />And I won&#039;t respect anyone who disrespects me like that, including mods, he was the one who started the insults so he got it back. And I wouldn&#039;t waste my damn time on this if it wasn&#039;t really serious. All I ask now is that the owner(s) check(s) the server logs, see that he really lied and is abusing of his mod status (and also abusing of the trust of other mods/admins too maybe) to try covering this up.

				This was quite entertaining. I am giving Range Rover a warning, which basically means if you continue to do sort of &quot;reckless&quot; and dumb things like minor power abuse, insulting and things like that, you could eventually get demoted. BH, could you lock this topic? In my opinion, I think we saw what happened here, no need for any more meaningless arguing. HC could check the logs, but I think it&#039;s not needed. Unless you, BCG2000, want to prove that you&#039;re right to everyone else, hehe.
