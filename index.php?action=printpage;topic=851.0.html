				I&#039;ve been banned for hacking/cheating just after killing someone, probably a moderator. I was using an M3 from short distance so what kind of hack i should use? Also i use Linux so i don&#039;t think there are any program to use hacks. I&#039;m not asking for a unban request, just suggesting to be careful on who you give moderator privileges.<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">[17:29:36] » M3 and tactical shield «<br />[17:29:36] DaNgEr#Bounty Hunter changes name to<br />&nbsp;dis is noob<br />[17:29:50] » http://hotchills.org «<br />[17:29:58] dis is noob killed CS-GO Häcker? with M3<br />[17:30:00] divyansh: is i am dis?<br />[17:30:13] Player killed dis is noob with M3<br />[17:30:17] dis is noob (All) *DEAD*: dis is me<br />[17:30:17] INVICTOS yso1 killed Angel naver die with M3<br />[17:30:20] Classnick killed INVICTOS yso1 with M3<br />[17:30:23] Classnick killed daniil with M3<br />[17:30:24] Player has left the game (banned)</code>

				Firstly, it was me who banned you. I saw you using aim. It was proven, I spent some time in spectators mode as AFK and I was seeking you.<br />Secondly, I&#039;m not perfect. If you can prove you weren&#039;t hacking, then perhaps it was mine mistake, tho I&#039;m sure of you being a hacker.<br />Thirdly, you were using player&#039;s name without USGN, i guess. That&#039;s hackers way.<br /><br />

				I can confirm that he was using Linux, no U.S.G.N. I don&#039;t know much about hacks, but I have never heard about CS2D hacks for Linux. That&#039;s all I have to add.

				@Happy Camper. I thought about that, too. But I was sure he was aiming. But that doesn&#039;t means I haven&#039;t made a mistake.

				You banned me just when i killed you. Perhaps, rage ban?<br />Also, when in doubt, you might at least kick or temp ban. This is simply a power abuse. Because i killed you twice.<br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">[17:26:49] » http://hotchills.org «<br />[17:26:55] Player killed DaNgEr#Bounty Hunter with Scout<br />[17:26:58] DaNgEr#Bounty Hunter (All) *DEAD*: aim?</code>Anyway, i don&#039;t care. If you say it was proven, good for you. There are no hacks on Linux that&#039;s the only proof here.

				How about Wine? Cheats should work with this on linux.<br />But im not sure, never had tried this. <br />Plus, if you bounty dont have any evidence, you cant perm ban him. <br />Just think, how much he might have hate for this server, after playing normally and got instant ban from random guy, without any warning. <br />LOIC wars 2015.

				Evaldai, I think your ideas about justice are right. But I was in spectators just to seek him. About wine, it can do almost everything in emulation, but I&#039;m not sure about it. I don&#039;t use it really often.
