				Well for a long time no new interesting post has come up so I came up with my own Question which I think will be pretty interesting<br /><br /><strong>How Did you come to know about cs2d ???</strong><br /><br /><br />My story:-<br />Actually few of you may know about http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK (http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK) which is essentialy a tool to make your camera scriptable (Guess what the scripting language is!!).So here I was looking for lua games which I thought might be possible to run on my Canon camera. Since cs2d also used lua, I ended up downloading and playing it, first of the servers being DraftCity,Jail and Hide and Seek.Slowly I started playing the multiMode genre and thus HC//Fun.

He was playing CS2D. I said to him if he tomorrow can go to my house and tell me how to download CS2D. I liked it, I kept playing during 1 year. Then, I took a break of CS2D during another year. 1 more year just playing -[IFwsI]-DogHouse, shotgun, and random maps.<br /><br />And, here I am.<br /><br /><br /><br />wtf siN xdddd .

				When i was a kid, my dad bought us our first computer but it wasn&#039;t new already. It was a used Pentium II with awful specifications that couldn&#039;t run normal games. At that time, my friends were already enjoying CS 1.6 and i couldn&#039;t even feel what it&#039;s like to play such games. <br />So, my best friend tried to help me out by finding some weak ass games.<br />Once, he stumbled upon Counter-Strike 2D and immediatelly told me about it, it was the year 2008. I downloaded it and i couldn&#039;t be happier. We played primitive rounds against bots, sometimes joining servers but we often got our asses kicked. <br />Then, my friend got a better PC and stopped playing 2D while i was improving myself.. (i just couldn&#039;t afford a normal PC, fml). During the first year i was playing Zombie Mode a lot and i even got rank 1 on a very popular server at that time - XCafe.net or sth like that. Then i switched to standart. Improved my skill a lot, game tactics, strategy, learned some tricks etc. <br />In 2010 i got a laptop (i&#039;m still using it). At that time it was a pretty good computer, core i3, 3Gb RAM, 2.13Ghz, 1Gb video... My dad played Crysis 2 on it, but i just continued playing CS2D because.. i fell in love with that game. I made a lot of friends, people recognize me, it was a fun experience. And yet, i still try to launch it at least twice a day. <br /><br />*wipes tears* <br />*continues to cry*<br /><br />Man, i trully love this game.<br /><br />

				Still a lot of off-topic, but I am too soft so I will tell you my story anyway. To punish you I have made it really long.<br /><br />Back in 2008 I was looking for some free, simple, fun multiplayer game to play online. Since I am a Linux guy, I wanted to be able to play in Linux. After some searching I found this site (http://play-free-online-games.com/) with an extensive list of games. I started going through the list and tried a few ones. There wasn&#039;t any interesting, really. But then I found this cute looking game called Counter-Strike 2D. I had played Counter-Strike so it caught my eye immediately. I downloaded it and started playing. Wow! This was really fun! I played on a CTF server for the rest of the evening. I couldn&#039;t wait to get up in the morning to continue playing.<br /><br />After a good night&#039;s sleep I continued exploring the server list. I joined a random server. It was running in construction mode, but I had no idea at first. What the heck were the other players doing with those wrenches? This wasn&#039;t part of the original Counter-Strike. Oh, they are building stuff. How do I do that? The lack of instructions was a slight problem but after some trial and error I succeeded. Cool, I can create stuff! Construction mode had been introduced recently so there were lots of construction servers out there.

To punish you I have made it really long.<br /><br />Back in 2008 I was looking for some free, simple, fun multiplayer game to play online. Since I am a Linux guy, I wanted to be able to play in Linux. After some searching I found this site (http://play-free-online-games.com/) with an extensive list of games. I started going through the list and tried a few ones. There wasn&#039;t any interesting, really. But then I found this cute looking game called Counter-Strike 2D. I had played Counter-Strike so it caught my eye immediately. I downloaded it and started playing. Wow! This was really fun! I played on a CTF server for the rest of the evening. I couldn&#039;t wait to get up in the morning to continue playing.<br /><br />After a good night&#039;s sleep I continued exploring the server list. I joined a random server. It was running in construction mode, but I had no idea at first. What the heck were the other players doing with those wrenches? This wasn&#039;t part of the original Counter-Strike. Oh, they are building stuff. How do I do that? The lack of instructions was a slight problem but after some trial and error I succeeded. Cool, I can create stuff!

				Time to be honest.<br /><br />My story:<br /><br />When I was young I was really lonely irl (still am) so I got some refugee in games, when I was 5 years old my kindergarden friends were playing dora the explorer and that shit while I was playing FPS games (which btw were forbidden #badboy)<br /><br />So after some baby research (babababaGAMES SHOOT bababab) I found us.de, I didn&#039;t understand a single shit at the time so I just randomly clicked everything until I accidently downloaded cs2d, Blablbla extracting was made by my father (#myfatherlovescallofdutyandfpsgames) and I started playing cs2d, bad aspect of it: I need glasses now because 11 years staring at a screen doesn&#039;t really help your vision, good aspect of it: Of so much fps gaming my reflexes are better than ever.<br /><br />In 2005 i discovered cs2d, and kept playing in single player until 2008 When I DISCOVERED THAT THIS GAME HAD A MULTIPLAYER FUNCTION, WHAT A FCKING GENIUS! Moving on, in 2011 i created my usgn (Dubstep Nation) and discovered the psK (now know as xGaming) clan, i improved my aim and strategy there a lot so I am rwally grateful to that clan &lt;3, 2013- I discovered that I was a teenager needing to fap(ok offtopic), 2016: HERE WE ARE AND I AM HERE WRITTING THIS!<br /><br />This is basically my story.

				I started out with playing a homebrew game called CSPSP (http://cspsp.appspot.com) on my newly bought (then haxed) PSP back in 2009. It was basically a 2D CS for the PSP. Lots of servers and players. It even had roleplay such as Jail. <br /><br />It used to have a master server which would list the servers on the client&#039;s game however during it went down some time around 2012, came back up after a long time and then periodically kept that up so many players were lost. I left after a while the developer open-sourced the game as he wasn&#039;t going to develop it anymore. <br /><br />CSPSP was an addicting game for me and when I heard about CS2D from a discussion about alternative &quot;CS 2D&quot; games on the community boards, I packed up and came here.<br /><br /><br />Incase you&#039;re curious about CSPSP, the community forums (http://s4.zetaboards.com/CSPSP/index/) is still there. Tho the forum spammed by bots, the chatbox is used for nostalgic discussions by the old members. And there&#039;s actually someone who&#039;s developing CSPSP (http://wololo.net/talk/viewtopic.php?p=359015) and there&#039;s a new master server (http://cspsp.vlad.tk/). Although, a few servers online, there&#039;s a lot of tumbleweeds in there.
