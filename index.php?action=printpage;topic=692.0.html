				Mr. Happy C@amper!<br />I want to suggest a thing to server.<br />There would be function to ignore person. You can&#039;t see any of ignored person&#039;s messages including broadcast, personal message and mods chat. This function would be available to all, including guests.<br /><br />I&#039;m writing this, because today Elfing, Oxoby, I, Maciek and SemihLord had a real flame/spam war.<br />You know - like there was sides - one guy agree with another, another agree with other and they start to fight, flame, spam, etc. But that was a bit funny, too xD But I wanted to have ability to mute SemihLord so I sugest to apply this thing for server. <br /><br />P.S. Elfing, thought of this idea, too.<br /><br />Congratz, Bounty

				I think I already suggested this:<br />http://hotchills.org/index.php/topic,430.msg5196.html#msg5196<br />Btw, muting a moderator is a bad idea, he might have important things to say, how about you guys stop fighting over nothing?<br />Oh and I haven&#039;t actually &quot;fought&quot; with someone.
