				Your english isnt even close to be a 10/10. Your vocabulary is very limited and you do a lot of grammar mistakes, so be honest about these ratings. You should&#039;ve known that&#039;s incoming coz im pretty sure you&#039;ve read many english articles etc. Before. Comparing yours to others i would intend to rate your english with an average of about 5-6.
