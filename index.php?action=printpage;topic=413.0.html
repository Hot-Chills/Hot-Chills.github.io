				This isn&#039;t a coincidence. It happened for the tenth time now... It&#039;s happening over and over again, either this is a bug or the server is getting high loads... out of 7 players...<br />Don&#039;t go inactive at a crucial time H@ppy Camper! D:

				Pssst..<br /><br />My guess is that if it really is DDoS then it&#039;s most likely being done by someone who knows Happy Camper is inactive right now aka. someone with a forum account.

				But I don&#039;t get this. Usually when the server goes down, the website goes down as well. Meaning that hotchills and the server is hosted from a single computer. Therefore, since the website is still up, it could be that there is a problem with the script for hosting the server AND there is no ddosor anything hacked.

				The website was soo laggy and then the server has crashed too.If HC host is on 1 pc then you&#039;re damned and if someone know the domain website track the most request from 1 IP no more than 1 ip cuz this site could be secured and the track that ip and you will know who the attacker is.

				Explain me one thing. If i play and server gets off 2 or 3 times in short period of time, is it crash or ddos? How can i know what happend? I know that ddos attacks became really popular nowdays

				My conclusion is that it&#039;s a script error. I don&#039;t know what the circumstances happy camper put behind it for it to restart but that could be the problem.
