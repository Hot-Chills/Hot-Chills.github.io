				Well guys. I&#039;m here again. Most of you know why I&#039;m applying again when my last application was accepted. ;o . http://hotchills.org/index.php/topic,1049.0.html .<br /><br />1 month has passed and I think I&#039;m ready to be JMod again.<br />No-need the application format. Everything is here: http://hotchills.org/index.php/topic,1049.0.html .<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />Bounty Hunter: Tell me Mast, do you think are you ready to get JMod in HC//Fun?<br />Me: Yes.<br />Bounty Hunter: Are you sure?<br />Me: Of course I am. <br /><br />Bounty Hunter: And, tell me Mast. Do you have any idea for can HC server get more players?<br />Me: HC// Human Hunt, HC// Gun Game. -For more details give me JMod. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -------All this converstion was invented by me-------<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Thank you everyone for reading.<br />

				Well this is not my decision to make, but I&#039;ll tell you people an incident few days ago....<br />I was playing by the name Player (Yeah the Generic &quot;Player&quot;) on one of the Deathrun server. I saw him playing but first ignored him,but the curiosity got the better of me and so I asked him about the &quot;incident&quot; indirectly and well Guess what I got in reply? He said that he got demoted due to muting a spammer!. And here I was thinking like a fool that you have realised what you have done.<br />Really? Even after a month I&#039;m a spammer?? That really hurt.<br /><br />I revealed my identity. He said nice then moved on. I&#039;ll provide the logs if you want.<br /><br />He in my last post said that I wanna destroy him.But this is not for &quot;revenge&quot;,to &quot;destroy&quot; him or nothing, all I wanted (and still want) was an explanation which made sense to me or an assurance that this will not happen again and maybe an apology (A sorry many times suffices in these minor scuffles).<br /><br />I just don&#039;t see any change and thus no reason for promotion.That&#039;s my opinion.(Highlighted because this seems to be a long post).<br /><br />I reiterate that its not my decision to make, it is HC//Fun&#039;s (Admins and Mods unanimously). I guess since you people already had him as a JMod you might find it easier to recruit him tham others but I hope that you people take my opinion into consideration as well.

I always though that if someone makes 3 comments or more, (in CS2D) with the same or a similar message = Spam.<br />If someone is changing his name to irrelevant nicknames like: GRIFF AGAINST BULLIES!!! or ID 8 ABUSER!!!!! and more shÂ¡t like that = Kick.<br /><br />Got it? :D .<br /><br /><br />
