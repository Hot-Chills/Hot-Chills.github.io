				ello, my name is Salah, i am 13 years old, my in game name is Jepo(I sometimes change it), my usgn number is 137411 and i would like to be a moderator of this mighty community.<br /><br />2- Personal information:<br /><br />I was born in Morroco, My parents are morrocans too., I&#039;m a morrocan, I&#039;ve learned English perfectly fine in 5 years. and French, well all morrocans know French, and Arabic. 3 Launguages.<br /><br /><br /><br />3- Skills in-game<br /><br />-I started playing CS2D in 2012. I give my self a&nbsp; 6/10 because I&#039;am not very good at aiming. I know all the game but not aiming.<br /><br />-At mapping, Well, I edit maps sometimes when nothing to do but I give my self in this skill 4/10.<br />-At scripting, I don&#039;t like Lua, I just download lua scripts and use it on my hosted server, I don&#039;t really need to study lua.<br /><br />4-&nbsp; Why would you accept me:<br /><br />Well, I&#039;m not active alot, I may be only in weekends because school is starting, and I need to study alot. But I still hard work in CS2D moderating. I&#039;d better do so.<br />So if you accept me back again, Imma help the server more than before I guess so.<br /><br /><br />How Active I will be,<br /><br />I will be active in the weekend only. 5/4 hours, school starting, need to study hard.<br /><br />6- My personal opinion: (This should be different than the other apply btw)<br /><br />In my opinion the server is cool, I like to play in it. The community is helpful and there&#039;s no rule breakers at all.<br /><br />I&#039;m ready to help the community and the server from any hacker, rule breakers or everything!<br />I&#039;ll try to keep the server always safe :)<br /><br /><br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Jepo (ExConq)

I also speak my mother tongue German, his is Arabic. Also i speak french and english!<br />I got Moderator rank because i am active enough for this, why he should get this rank?
