				Hello guys and female associates<br /><br />I decided to apply back, reasons? Enough time to moderate/have fun playing<br /><br />School is giving me a break and I wanna take it and enjoy my time in the first community which I&#039;ve moderated<br /><br />My info is already on my previous apply by the way<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if it is too much to ask for s-mod, but mods can only ban cheaters for one day and I want to PERMANENTLY ban them<br /><br />Eitherway, I&#039;ve banned a lot of cheaters so far without mod powers, just ask EngiN33R or Fraizeraust.<br /><br />Hope you accept me and have a great day<br /><br />Cheers ur boi siN<br /><br />Usgn: 78872<br /><br />

				I cannot promote anyone below the rank of VIP. Also, how will you keep your SMod rank if you&#039;re not actively playing/moderating in the server? No offense to you of course, just curious.

I know you&#039;re active nowadays. But i see you more on the doghouse server than on HC:Fun. Also, everybody here has a life beyond cs2d. You&#039;re no different. So, chill. I like you as a player. I know how good you play. But you should get your MOD rank first then apply for SMOD.

				Electron I was going to do that but don&#039;t get me wrong I do not have the patience to come here everytime I ban a hacker for one day, it is just too ridiculous imo, I rather ban them permanently and seize their activity immediatly.<br /><br />PS: I think I got demoted by that activity system, not by an admin<br /><br />EDIT: Lets face reality, HC FUN rarely has a lot of players in it, obviously I won&#039;t join the server just to moderate bots, whenever HC // Fun gets players I join there, otherwise I am at other servers hunting for cheaters

				I need to agree with sin in some point. Most of the time, just bots are playing and there is nothing to watch and it decreases activity for sure. If I don&#039;t play against bots possibly I wouldn&#039;t make the needed time for keep mod rank but sometimes I play against bots lonely for a short time. Only Leumas plays with bots for a long time :) and i&#039;m not sure what he is gonna do after achieve #1 in server.
