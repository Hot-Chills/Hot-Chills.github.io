				The server is up again. I think it went down due to a power outage. I was away so I couldn&#039;t turn it on until now.

				I would be glad if moderators lose their rangs. Moderators should be active enough that even small &quot;server downtime&quot; didnt make a difference

				@Maciek: I&#039;m sorry but that&#039;s bullshit. There already is this auto remove script that forces moderators to play a certain amount of time if they don&#039;t want to lose their rank. Now expecting them to play even more while they actually can&#039;t because the server is down makes no sense at all.

				smod need to play 2h/ 2 week ? Something like that. Its really minimum.. If every smod play only that amount of time we would need 20 of them to prevent server from hackers. Apfelbrot.. i saw you maybe twice.. you probably play just as much as you need to hold ur rank. Your activity on forum isnt big too. Is it big deal to make 2h per one week? Its like 17 min per day.. you dont even need to play, you can put yourself on spec (for example take a shower) and watch from time to time. Server need active moderators not dudes whose aim is to hold their ranks cause its cool.

				I agree. And yet expecting people to play more because they can&#039;t makes no sense. If you want more active moderators, the minimum time played before moderators become auto-removed has to be increased.<br />Also notice that I&#039;m not playing cs2d anymore, so it&#039;s quite unlikely that you get to see me playing. So I&#039;m not trying to keep my rank, I&#039;m just using logic on your previous post.
