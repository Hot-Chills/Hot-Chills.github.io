				Hi all! I have been Jmod 1 month maybe it isn&#039;t too much but I consider myself ready to be promote. I decided to ask for promotion yesterday when I saw a speedhacker/insulter I muted him after some warnings but he came back after that I kicked him but he came back again. Like Jmod I cant ban, and there are a lot of players like these, please I need at least give temp ban to these players who only seek to ruin the server.<br />I wont be abusive, I will follow the moderator&#039;s rules. I&#039;m just looking for a better server.<br /><br />about my activity:<br /><br />Last 7 days: Playing: 8 h 38 m. Spectating: 5 m 33 s. AFK: 36 m 24 s.<br />Last 14 days: Playing: 16 h 43 m. Spectating: 43 m 31 s. AFK: 59 m.<br />Last 30 days: Playing: 1 days 20 h. Spectating: 1 h 9 m. AFK: 2 h 14 m.<br /><br />Well that´s all, thanks :)<br />

				Sorry. Bad &#039;keyboard&#039; at smarthphone.<br />I mean that he is active enough in the game.<br />And that should be a reason why a JMod get promoted to Mod.<br />Also i mean that at the moment there arent many post which are new in forum. I miss the activity here. Not often new posts.

Make up your mind then. At first, you say that being active in the forum isn&#039;t necessary to get promoted. But after that you state that it&#039;s not enough to only be active in-game, that you need to be active in the forum to get promoted. Hmph.
