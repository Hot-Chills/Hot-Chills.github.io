				Hello all. I made this thread because I am seeing Members Inactivity on server I mean peoples who made app for JMOD - MOD - SMOD.I never saw them playing on server.I just wanna help to ADMIN TEAM solve this problem.When I am playing on server 1-2 mins only for seeing if some JMOD - MOD - SMOD is active but I dont see anyone active on server.Of course I play longer that this 1-2 minutes . When i play 1-2 mins just as i said I only come to server for seeing if some JMOD - MOD - SMOD is online.If i made mistake that I said for some JMOD - MOD - SMOD that he didn&#039;t come to server and he did , sorry then.<br /><br />But lets think about this : Why peoples here made application for MOD if they are not active in server and playing? Why? For losing it? My logic is if you made application for MOD come to server play per day some 20-30 mins on HC fun be active on server.Not just Make application - Just look for when will some Admin accept u and - When they accept u, u dont care u have now MOD and u are Master.No! Admin team must change this do something about this.<br /><br />Some asked me I remember long time ago &quot;Why MODS are not active here&quot; , I just said I dont know man.<br /><br />And that inactivity of MODS didn&#039;t changed in times.<br /><br />I think this server is most popular server ever and we cant let this happen to server(I mean about this inactivity of MODS).<br /><br />Do something about this ADMIN team if you can.<br />Thank&#039;s for reading.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Keno

				We have an activity script that removes the moderators status if they stay inactive for a long time (they need to play x hours a month etc.) Also mods here are doing their best to keep the server clean, I see mods quite often on the server, so stop bashing people for nothing.<br />If Happy Camper thinks that they really are inactive, he will just bump up the minimum activity hours every month by 2-3 hours.<br />

				KeNo, you get it all wrong. Don&#039;t start teaching more experienced guys as Elfie. The point is, that if mod gets inactive, he&#039;s demoted to lower rank. (see http://hotchills.org/index.php/topic,221.0.html (http://hotchills.org/index.php/topic,221.0.html)) If mod don&#039;t wants to loose his rank, but he really cannot be active for a while, he posts his inactivity report and is pinned &#039;till set date. (see http://hotchills.org/index.php/topic,250.0.html (http://hotchills.org/index.php/topic,250.0.html))
