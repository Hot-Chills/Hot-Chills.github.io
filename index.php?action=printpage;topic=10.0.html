				The type of round I came up with is this:<br /><br />Normal, full map, both terrorist and counter terrorist spawn at their regular spots. The weapon in use would be <br /><strong>-Tactical Shield<br />-Machete<br />-HE (unlimited)</strong><br />The map would be filled with neutral (yellow) <strong>turrets</strong>, not too much so it won&#039;t slow the game (and lag) not too less so it wont be too easy (and therefore the point of the round would be ruined). The theme behind this round is that even thought both teams have to kill each other, they would have the other enemy (turrets) to keep an eye on. It would require teamwork in order to go through turrets faster ( one holding shield - turrets focusing on him while the others throwing HE etc). Additionally you could add npc monsters, such as <strong>zombies</strong> (in reasonable amount), it&#039;s very entertaining in my opinion fighting with a zombie with a machete and HE (when he&#039;s got right amount of HP, of course). All the details and everything actually is up to a administrator, so its just brief idea, which could be improved further on.

				Well, another idea.<br />Standart spawn. Players haven&#039;t money. Near the player&#039;s spawn is gold, coins and money, but it&#039;s limited (for total amount about 20.000$). Players must take them, how many succeed. They must buy weapons on this money. And buy time is small (1.5-2 minutes or less).<br />Or random spawn and buy zone (unlimited) throughout the map. Money, coins and gold on the map (also random). Players collect gold and buy weapons.

				About the Machete + Shield + HE with turrets/NPCs<br /><br />Machetes are 1-hit kill weapons that are very useful at dismantling turrets and rushing unsuspecting enemies so they would be essential to survival I guess.<br /><br />Overall I like the idea, it just needs to be balanced right.

				&quot;Suicide Bomber&quot;<br />Everyone have airstrike, but players can&#039;t throw it. Instead of it, when player press left mouse button, he explodes. The sense of this idea - to blow up with itself is as much as possible players. I don&#039;t know about spawn or speed, and If there are 2 players alive, and player, who will explode first, even if he blew up with himself an opponent, he anyway will lose. <br />Also the player may not explode himself, but he can explode enemies. Interval between the explosions should be several seconds (5-10), or explosion can be only one time. If the explosion is spent, then the players have to kill enemies with knife. Then it is logical to make spawn in small area with buildings (near CT base or in the middle of the map).<br />This is just &quot;alpha&quot; version of my idea, and it should be finished thinking. Maybe somebody here knows how to improve this idea ;)<br />I hope that this idea is understood&nbsp; :D

				Every player have random weapon (from airstrike to xm1014). But after a shot, the weapon changes on another random weapon.

				Your first idea would be fun but the second will end up in a mess; cheaters/hackers with radar hacks and stuff would still know where the enemies are, correct me if I&#039;m wrong.&nbsp; <br /><br />Instead a round with awp only (no grenades, no scout, no machete) and walls for cover could be quite interresting if you ask me.

				I like the assassins creed idea but it would be better if there would be walls or barricades spawned on random places.<br />I suggest a one shot kill round like you get a deagle and you shoot once and well the person you shot is dead.(&lt;--Not sure if that round is already created or if someone suggested it above)

				Hi all. I have couple if ideas, but not sure if some of them are possible... Engine may not be capable... i am not very familar with free game engines out there, isn&#039;t there some new.. free...better engines who can do more with this game? Well first graphic is kinda outdated... Just imagine for a sec how much better this game would be with better graphics... but lets keep it on topic. So my ideas for a level...<br /><br />- I have in my mind that: A round start. All players are with no weapons - well maybe Fist? But they need to run in order to stay alive. What i mean is - in every 5 sec or so, someone will explode and that will be the last player who got safe spot. A safe spots will be random (or not) generated on the ground/map. And when last player step on that spot he explode. Then is reset and so on and so on until 1 player stay alive. Sound good right?&nbsp; :)<br /><br />- i was so excided about this so i forgat others ideas... xD<br /><br />- What about from the sky randomly drops Molotov Kokteil and all players are like 20HP ... got the picture?<br />-

				1) A round with every player starts off with 5 hp and only uses a knife. Its fast and simple round :D<br /><br />2) Round starts off with super armour and everyone has an elite and machete. A slow game but gives players a chance to hv a kill. :)<br /><br />3) A speed round with a machine gun and HE. There will be mines on the map also.<br /><br />4) theres a 2 weapons in the middle of the map 1 for the CT and one for the TT. The teammates will hv to race each other to get their hands on the gun. The player who have the gun hv to try kill the other team. They must avoid dying and lets the gun to the other team.

The goal is normal too kill the other team the only thing is that everybody are 1 shoot from knife (35 HP no Kevlar).It is possible to kill the guy with Minigun it just reqeuires teamwork.

				I would ask if can happy camper use a special script that can be active on a special round?<br /><br />What i&#039;m thinking in : Every player spawn in the normal spawn , the player gets 5 smoke grenades (using a script that puts 4 in inventory and the player have the 5th smoke grenade in hand) , also the player haves a mac 10 with a 2 flashs.<br /><br />So what you have to do with 5 smoke grenades ? Throw them to a place and teleport to that place (using a script) ...<br /><br />That&#039;s it , i hope u like the idea , i would name this round &quot;Ninja Masters&quot; or something like that..

				1) suit health + knf + flashbangs + 10hp = this round could be called &quot;Ninja&quot; <br /><br />ps: the spawn of the players needs to be in random places<br /><br />2) m4 + kevlar100% + he + flashbangs + smoke + deagle = this round could be called &quot;Aim&quot;

				Hey what happened to the a taste of everything?<br />I would also suggest that there should be like <br /><br />A taste of stealth (silenced guns: tmp, forced silencer on USP, M4A1,Stealth Suit and forced crouch)(dunno if it&#039;s possible)<br /><br />A taste of time: Every 5 seconds, guns change (for example, we have USP then claw then sniper)<br /><br />The last being health auction, where one would pay a specific amount of health and armor for a gun. For a more powerful gun, you have to pay more!<br /><br />

				A &quot;play like men&quot; round.<br /><br />In it, you have AK-47 and Deagle, while Fog of War is activated.<br /><br /><br /><br />A &quot;Classic&quot; round.<br /><br />So, basically you get a random but balanced primary and secondary weapon, but Terrorists have a C-4 and Counter-Terrorists have a Defuse Kit.<br /><br /><br /><br />A &quot;Flamethrower + Super Armor&quot; round.
