				Don&#039;t stay still, keep moving. A stationary target is easier to shoot.

				Use quickswitches, get familiar with your cs2d keyboard controls. Switch to knife when you&#039;re moving and to your weaponry when you&#039;re attacking.

				Best way and long to read btw :)&nbsp; :<br /><br />You start in a base, blue or red. You want to win but you don&#039;t know how?<br />Let&#039;s start. You met an enemy in a corner. He is behind a wall and you want to know how to kill him? make sure you already hold your gun and knife.. do a quick - switch to your gun and shoot at him but make sure you point at him your mouse, if you want to troll somebody that wants knife. Tell him Yes, and use your gun to kill him. easy, and make sure you follow him never NEVER lose your pointer from your enemy as i do :p<br /><br />-------------------<br /><br />That was it :p hope it helped a little little little bit :d

				Well , first of all , you have to dodge his attacks , and at same time run out of his vision , try to shoot him if you was in a corner and the enemy don&#039;t have any thing to hide with , try to use grenades as much as you can , but don&#039;t give the grenades the first choose always ..
