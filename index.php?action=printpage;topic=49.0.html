				Hey Guys: some strange things while playing on server nighttime:<br /><br />1. in the &quot;fast&quot; rounds(little minimaps) sometimes people spwan in the normal map. This leads to big confusion, cause they cant kill each other and they blame each other for hacking :D<br /><br />2. In the &quot;stealth suit&quot; round I found normal armor on the map. The people who walked over it were visible then and had 50% armor. I guess it is not suppose to be happening :)&nbsp; &nbsp; The players &quot;Unknown Identity&quot; and &quot;Unknown Real&quot; were on the map. I kicked them once before for hacking, maybe they were the reason...<br /><br />3. Everyone knows the hat bug, hope one day it will&nbsp; be fixed :)<br /><br />4. I have a very good connection, but in little &quot;famas&quot; rounds or &quot;knive&quot; rounds sometimes my pc nearly crashes, i was often kicked cause my window just closed! I don&#039;t have any ideas how to fix that one.<br /><br />5. during 23:00 and 1:00 night time GMT, the server sometimes resets 4 - 5 times and was down for &gt; 5mins. didn&#039;t know what was going on, we lost all our players... long time after that only 6 bots playing!<br /><br />That&#039;s it for the last 3 days :D I neither dont think those are great bugs nor think they will happen often. So just take them as information ;) <br /><br />Greetings from Germany ;)&nbsp; <br /><br />Chilla_Girl :*<br /><br />

				Great job writing all these down, this list is fairly useful for Happy Camper.<br /><br />About some of the bugs:<br />1) Those peoppe who spawn outside join a bit after the round has started. Had it happen to myself too. <br /><br />2)This I haven&#039;t heard of. Only seen a few stealth suits lying around every now and then.<br /><br />3) Known bug.<br /><br />4) Some people do complain about lag, but I haven&#039;t noticed it.<br /><br />5) Probably has something to do with the actual server itself.<br />

				Thanks for the list.<br /><br />1) This could be a CS2D bug, because I saw the same problem at [LaG] Fun. I suspect the join hook isn&#039;t called.<br />2) I haven&#039;t seen this one either. I have no idea how it could happen.<br />3) I haven&#039;t had time to look at it, but I will.<br />4) Try lowering your graphics settings.<br />5) The server restarted automatically since it didn&#039;t receive any update serverlist reply. The reason for this is unknown. It could be someone hacking, a bug in CS2D or connectivity problems.

				Nr. 4 is because there&#039;s too much stuff on the screen and your computer slows down. Decrease graphics quality, blood amount etc. :d

				I just want an Info about that one:<br /><br />I often use the mouse wheel at the beginning of a round to scoll to my first weapon. When I am T it sometimes happens that i have the &quot;bomb&quot;, which is annoying because it causes an automatic switch to knife, and if i press &quot;Q&quot; it switches between bomb(-&gt;knife) and knife.... <br /><br />Is this problem solved in the last server update? Happened to me yesterday, but could have happened due to the errors with the scripts (yesterday the map was called de_dust again).<br /><br />Main Question: Are only the Bombspots removed or is the bomb as item removed, too? :)<br /><br />Greetings from Germany,<br /><br />Chilla_Girl

				There were some problems yesterday with de_dust being loaded instead of dm_dust. I had forgotten to update mapcycle.cfg so it went back to de_dust after every server restart.<br /><br />The bombspots are removed from dm_dust so CS2D will not put a bomb on one of the terrorists.<br /><br />The knife problem should have been solved. Let me know if you still see it.
