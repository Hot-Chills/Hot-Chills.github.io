				Like the name implies, these are just a few basic things I find should be on your apply. I don&#039;t want you to copy/paste them, as I like the applies written freely.<br />But if possible, answer these questions in your apply:<br /><br />1) USGN ID<br /><br />2) In-game name.<br /><br />3) How active you can/will be.<br /><br />4) Have you had any prior experience as a moderator?<br /><br />5) Why exactly do you want to be a Mod/SMod ?<br />(the above question is actually useful in several ways for us, so go ahead and write what you think)<br /><br />6) *OPTIONAL* Something about yourself you think we should/could know.<br /><br /><strong>NB!</strong> Do <strong>not</strong> send me your applies via Personal Message. if you can&#039;t post in this section this probably means I&#039;m currently not accepting any new applies.<br /><br />Also I urge you to write your applies in English.<br /><br /><strong>Applying for a promotion:</strong><br /><br />Initially, as a new player you will apply for the position of a Moderator and then (assuming you were accepted) you will either be assigned as a Junior Moderator (J-Mod) or a normal Moderator (Mod). Most people will start as a Junior Moderator, a rank with limited powers where you will be examined, or &quot;tested&quot;, if you prefer that term. Instantly starting off as a (regular) Moderator presumes that you are known and trusted by the Administrators (Me and Turkey).<br /><br />Now, on to the actual promoting. There are no set requirements or goals that you must fulfil before you can apply for a promotion, although the soonest is the <em>next</em> period of time in which we will be accepting new applies. That means you can&#039;t instantly apply for a promotion after being accepted as a J-Mod/Mod.<br /><br />The application itself should be like any other apply, though you should point out that you are indeed asking for a promotion (preferably in the name/subject of the topic). If you get rejected for whatever reason, the soonest time to re-apply is once again the next time I start accepting new applies.<br /><br />If you have any more questions about this or anything, feel free to send me a personal Message (PM).<br /><br /><br />When I think of anything else useful/someone else tells me (don&#039;t be shy to PM your ideas) I will add it to the list.<br />For now, that&#039;s it.<br /><br /><br />

				Added another paragraph (or 3 :P) about the promotion system. Thank you Ezio for coming forth and asking me to explain this little &quot;system&quot; that has been confusing quite a few newer members of the community.
