				1- Brief Introduction, <br /><br />Hello, my name is Nathan, i am 15 years old born on the 6th of January, my nickname is GeekØfWar | Gen.John, my USGN number is 138728<br /><br />2- Personal information:<br /><br />I was born in Canada my parents are Mauritian, i’ve been learning many languages since i’m 3 years old and can now talk in 3 languages (English, French, and Chinese) english and Chinese are my main languages<br /><br />3- How good is my English:<br /><br />English is my main language<br /><br />4- Skills in-game<br /><br />-Well, since I play CS2D for a long time Since 2013 (2014 with USGN). I give my self 7.5/10 when i try, if not then a 5/10<br /><br />-At mapping, I&#039;m okay when i get specific directions<br /><br />5-&nbsp; Why would you accept me:<br /><br />Well, I didn’t want to join just for my own purpose.. but to help this server<br />So if you accept me i will try to make the best of what i can with this great server<br /><br />As my responsibility&#039;s i will try to make the gameplay as fair as i can to everyone (no hackers) and report hackers if i see them<br /><br /><br />[How Active I will be]<br /><br />Well i love this server because of all the fun everyone can get. It shall be between 1 hour mostly at night and 3-4 hours on weekend<br /><br />6- My personal opinion:<br /><br />HC//Fun is easily one of the most visited servers (over 5000) but there are lots of lag every since it had switched IP addresses. I think lag is the only issue to really solve. buy it only happens on some of the flamethrower rounds and the machine guns rounds<br /><br />Sorry i wasn&#039;t that active a bit after i got accepted, got a lot of homework and my internet was crap, if i&#039;ll be inactive i&#039;ll tell you guys now

				Why that? He is a good player with good communication skills. He deserves it to become jmod/mod/smod again more than some other which got accepted. Also he was already jmod/mod/smod with a reason.

				Yeah and thats my opinion N&#039;. You cant change. Also i think his application has a good form but might have to much colours. But the content is okay. Also i saw him often on server, also he is a good person who can handle also as JMod. Why you have a hate on him?

				Let me make this clear that we take decisions on the basis of mods&#039;s opinions or according to our own will(in case we know the applicant very well).<br />If he&#039;s rejected then he can apply again.
