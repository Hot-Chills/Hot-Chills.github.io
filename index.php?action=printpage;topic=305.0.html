				It&#039;s not happy&#039;s fault. I wrote with Evaldas yesterday evening. He said he is just using a bug that is not fixed yet. And the one to blame for is unreal software... They 1. caused the bug, and 2. wrote the fact that this bug exists on their website (so everyone could know about this bug and use it) ... 2 horrible mistakes.. <br /><br />-&gt; We can only wait, til DC or some smart guy has a lot of free time :D

				Evaldas visited HC fun yesterday, and asked me if he could test the bug :D I said, i can&#039;t hold him if he does :D <br /><br />--&gt; Evaldas got auto-kicked (for reload spamming)<br />--&gt; he returned and said to me that the bug is now fixed!<br /><br />(Maciek, you got auto-kicked for reload spamming that one day, too :D maybe they try out something new at unreal software?! ;) )<br />

				This guy:<br />1. Says I am girl/boy, because my sister who is sometimes playing in CS2D changed my USGN name into hers name (now i changed name).<br />2. Says he saw me with speed! I do not hack. Maybe it was lag because my internet lags often but I doubt that it <strong>WASN&#039;T SPEED!</strong><br />3. He insult&#039;s me often. I said i&#039;ll mute him. Then he said: &quot;I can easy ban you&quot;.<br />What&#039;s that means?!<br />4. A long time ago he said he can teach me hacking/dossing. I rejected that stupid idea. No doubt he IS hacker.
