It&#039;s just that N` has been here for a while (and is way more active than you in the forums) so naturally it makes him more trustworthy than you appearing out of nowhere. However, like I said, I might be wrong, I haven&#039;t seen the logs yet.<br /><br />Jepo. Like scroLL3R said, you need to calm the fuck down. If you&#039;re so sensitive, maybe you should ignore those people that treat you like an idiot. You&#039;re making no effort at all to get your rank back and you also accuse Tiky while having no proof. I hope you realize that this is childish.

				Jepo, right? Your behaviour is childish. You are crying for nothing. N&#039;s language skills are quite well and if we compare it to yours, they arent better or bader than yours.<br />Secondly they didnt accept any guys, N&#039; is a reliable and the most active player on the hotchills server.<br />So if have nothing interesting to add, go to your mom and cry there...

Anyway, you seem to underestimate me. I guess you don&#039;t know that I&#039;m able to demote people and stuff like that (referring to the fact that you said I only sit in the forums). Guess what, I don&#039;t use my powers when I don&#039;t need to! About your promotion. I told you what you need to do. You chose not to listen to me. Very well.

I think you&#039;re not aware of that Bonzo accepted N&#039; in this community. And about Turkey , he&#039;s been here since the beginning. He&#039;s alot better than you. We don&#039;t accept people here only on the basis of their English skills. (It doesn&#039;t mean that they have to be perfect in English. It should be understandable.
