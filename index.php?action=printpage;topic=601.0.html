				Here i&#039;ll place my ban reports.<br /><br />1. Today I banned one speed hacker named Cheater Hack Club. He was in TT team. CT were attacking and TT were running away. When he saw that we&#039;ll be able to shoot him, he runned away with enormous speed. I saw it and his ping was normal, about 97, not bad.<br /><br />Info:<br /># 11: Cheater Hack Club<br />Level: Guest<br />IP: 114.79.32.75<br />Country: Indonesia

				2. There is well known player piwi. He said his grandfather&#039;s name is Adolf. He had name Adolf H. a few times. I kept censoring him. He was against me saying that Adlof is his grandfather. I say that it is okay (if it&#039;s true) but he can&#039;t add letter H. <br />What to do with him?&nbsp; ???

Secondly, I require, that every mod must not curse. Just think what can happen if other player will see it. They&#039;ll think, that cursing is just a joke and they&#039;ll think they can curse <em><span class="bbc_u">because they saw mod doing it.</span></em>. Thirdly, gays is bad word, it can be used as insulting. Even answering to question with curse is foolish thing.

				NOTICE: SO i was playing on energetics | cs2d server when I met pul9. Teh famous person making the cs2d hacks. So he offered me to try it and yeah I downloaded it and checked it out(with major precautions). It was 100% legit. He was spamming the server with the links and so yeah. One thing that the server gave me was his country&#039;s info. It was Indonesian. <br />This Notice by means is to keep an eye on Players from Indonesia because most of them use hacks and with pul9 spamming the links everywhere, this will spread quickly.
