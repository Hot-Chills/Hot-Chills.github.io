				Title: <strong>Dynamic Server IP Address?</strong><br />

				Hi, <br />I think this might pull down the % of ddos attacks on the server. And that the dynamic IP would change every 2-5 hours, or if the ddos attack is frequent, then every hour. This might be a problem for the players, but who cares? I still love this server, and it will/might protect it, because ddos needs time to send enough packets to crash a computer, not 1 hour, it might take days.<br /><br />And the best way for me to make a dynamic IP address is:<br />ipconfig /flush<br />ipconfig /renew<br /><br />Takes a few seconds, then you&#039;re good to go. It would be easy if you could make a batch file like this, then download a &quot;cron jobs&quot; type software to make it run, or I think there is already a system like that on windows. (I saw it once on XP, cant be sure it will be on higher versions).<br /><br />Cheers, <br />Nighthawk

I am not sure this is a good solution. Every time the IP address has changed before, the number of players has dropped for several weeks. I am afraid we will have to live with the ddos attacks.

				It&#039;s your call, but I think players that love your server (like me :P) won&#039;t really leave because of the changing of the ip.<br />Cheers.
