				Before the ddos attacks i saw a guy joining as Player 3 (ID: 57648)<br />He stayed in specs the whole time, which was pretty suspicious.<br />I&#039;m guessing it might have been him, although i might be wrong.

				Wow 0.o <br />Ddosing other servers so that people would play on his one&#039;s... That&#039;s just the next level of douche-baggery. <br />Thank you Cirium for the confirmation, you did a really good job! <br />Now we need ŦƲƦƙɘƳ to permanently ban him.

				Ohh that&#039;s nothing. Good to know its useful to you though. You could spend hours analyzing the attacks and learning about them. Not like that&#039;l help though in the end.<br /><br />Many of the attacks that take place in CS2D seem to be empty packet attacks. Which are mostly blockable using the correct firewall rules if you know what you&#039;re doing. (Two weeks ago took a hit of 60,000packets/sec from &#039;Pelennor&#039; and his 4 VPSes. CS2D server was still playable and my box was mitigating every packet sent to it. Was quite impressed.)<br /><br />Ultimately DDoS protection needs to be enabled 24/7 for this kind of attack, and even then I find that this &quot;Alex&quot; guy seems to switch his methods of attacks now and again making them difficult to mitigate. Not much that can be done but wait it out.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Cirium.
