				I want to be a part of Hot Chills so I decided to make my own apply, let&#039;s go to start introducing myself because the most people don&#039;t know me.<br /><br />Caza&#039;s intoduction:<br /><br />I&#039;m a lazy guy, love the games and music like dubstep, rap and some other spanish&#039;s styles.<br />I&#039;m 16 years old, my birthday is on 1st of November.<br />I born in Spain and I&#039;m actually living there.<br />I was absent 2 years from cs2d because of my computer died then I spent my time on Call of Duty BO2 and some others games for xbox 360.<br />I was working with my father and I bought a new computer, then I turned back to CS2D. Also I&#039;m in a clan called BG, starting a new project called Prodigy2D | Happy Town that I hope it comes to be a little famous and the s*** of IRAN TOWN die (sorry for those bad words) and I&#039;m ranked in some other servers that people who play there know it.<br />I&#039;m one of that guys that travel around web looking funny stuff, crap, downloads and music. I like go out with my friends every day. ;)<br /><br />Well that&#039;s all, I think.<br /><br />1) USGN ID<br />54131<br /><br />2) In-game name.<br />Caza<br /><br />3) How active you can/will be.<br />The most time as posible depending of the day.<br /><br />4) Have you had any prior experience as a moderator?<br />Of course as I mentioned before I was moderator in some clans, also member in a lot of them, I&#039;m the owner of Prodigy2D but that can&#039;t be mentioned as big experience because I opened it a month ago, I&#039;m CT in darftcity that is a hard community to join and also there are good staffs.<br /><br />5) Why exactly do you want to be a Mod/SMod ?<br />(the above question is actually useful in several ways for us, so go ahead and write what you think)<br />As everybody who want be a moderator/member of a community, to help the best as possible that I have in my hand and also to ban every rule breaker (that I didn&#039;t see anyone since I joined the server for first time).<br /><br />6) *OPTIONAL* Something about yourself you think we should/could know.<br />You don&#039;t need to know this but I always thought that is a funny story.<br />When I tried cs2d for first time (2011) I hadn&#039;t any knowledge in english but after join NoPain clan I started to be interested at improve my skills but as I didn&#039;t like it at school I was using google translate&nbsp; ;D, the advantage was NoPain members who helped me when I said some bad word and to create a good sentences. Anyway my english is not the best that you ever seen before but it&#039;s good enough to have an understandable conversation with me. If I need rate it n a scale of 1 to 10 then I select 7.<br /><br />Thanks for read it and thank you for make the most harder registraton form :P<br /><br />Regards,<br />Caza.
