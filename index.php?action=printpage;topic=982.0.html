				Hello, my name&#039;s jepo and today i will explain why i&#039;m leaving.<br /><br />As you know i&#039;m a moderator at HC//Fun, I&#039;ve been protecting the server with everything i could do but people no longer wants me, everyone accuses me as a hacker, everyone accuses me as a abuser and I no longer support that.. I do everything i could do but no one give a helping hand, so the only solution was for me to leave, and I&#039;m no longer in HC//Fun so people should take me as a simple guest, I no longer support people at this community that calls me an abuser and hacker, So bye, if you want to chat with me send me a PM or just do a quick reply in this thread, I will be still responding.<br /><br />Edit: May&nbsp; come back if people could stop calling me a hacker.<br /><br />Bye people, bye fellow friends.

				I don&#039;t really want you to leave. I mean people were accusing you as a hacker quite a while ago and only once. Anyway, that&#039;s your decision, so I can&#039;t just force you to be here. Goodbye. I hope you change your mind.

				If &quot;MOST&quot; don&#039;t accuse as a hacker, then most accuses as a abuser, you can change my mind if you give it try&#039;s and by saying that i&#039;m not trying to be immature.

				Why should i reply? It&#039;s uncessary to repeat the apply&#039;s again over again, by the way Tiky is an complete abuser, Warn him.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: You know what? I&#039;m leaving.<br /><br />Got banned by one of the cowards in the mod team, NoSleeping2222222222<br />&nbsp;HC, feel free to ban me in this community, enough of this crap.<br /><br />and Turkey, just close this thread.

				It&#039;s not about ruining things. If N` banned him that means he had a reason to. We gave Jepo a chance, we tried to get him back, but it seems our words mean nothing to him. Furthermore, he&#039;s acting like a child these couple of days, so I see no reason to keep him in the moderator team because of such behavior.
