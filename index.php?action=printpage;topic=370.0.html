				How long do you play? I play since 2006, i am 100% sure that u never saw real aimbot. I am 62 level on this server, i spend there so many days. So, you listen to players who played 2 days, that player who is one of the oldest cs2d player right now, is hacking? Ask anybody WHO HAVE experience, about me. One of best players (prolly inactive) N&#039; (he had similar skill to mine) will tell you that i am not hacker. I dont know where you saw aimbot.. (Aimbotters aim, jumps after kill to the closest ENEMY. CLOSEST ENEMY (Check what it mean) So if i shot person who is last, just by luck i am not hacker. I am slowly gettin mad, I hate when unexperienced people call me hacker. I am going to calm down for this week, hope that there willl be a discuss about that. <br />Its called unfounded accusation of innocent player who is sensitve about this one point. <br />(tip for you, come watch me and mnake video, i bet you, that you wont find anything)

				You know, i came here (i talk about creating this post) to clear myself from this cruel accusations. You know, its my biggest weakness, i hate to be called hacker..<br />I would like to announce then:<br />Guys! All of you. Everybody who thinks i am hacker, i ask you to hold it for yourselfs untill you get vidoe in which you can clearly see how my aim jumps from killed person to another. I ask you about this cus of simply reason, it is my worst side. You can see that i am immature sometimes so i ask you too dont provoke me in this one aspect.
