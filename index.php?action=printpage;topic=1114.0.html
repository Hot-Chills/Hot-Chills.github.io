				Hi all,<br /><br />My name is Berk, 19 years old, and I&#039;m from Turkey. My game name is Ezergecer and my USGN number is 17442. I&#039;d like to apply for J-mod.<br /><br />I&#039;m native Turkish speaker and also know English. English is my 2nd language so i cannot speak like native but I&#039;ve never had a communication problem in English.<br /><br />I started to play cs2d in 2010 and left when HC // Construction was down (don&#039;t remember when but couple years ago) I was in top 10 in hc construction also vip. Back in time, I mostly played hc construction and lag fun. Now, I usually play hc fun and ranked 119th I started 3-4 weeks ago don&#039;t remember my first rank but it was around 700-800th. I can consider myself as a good player since I played with the top ranked guys who are still active in game. My kpd ratio is currently 2.26. I don&#039;t know anything about lua and scripts.<br /><br />I have no experience being moderator before i just had vip for hc construction which we had basic powers like 2 vip vote can kick a player which was really useful because server was always +10 players and mostly 2-3 vip was there.<br /><br />I want to be a moderator because lately hack is increased and server is not crowded usually 2-3 players and bots. And some players are not registered to usgn and don&#039;t know how to kick a player. Even though we explain, like they are not even see the chat so in these situation we cannot kick a cheater. And my activity is not bad in server. In forum, i just joined because now server is down and searched the way to fix it which led me to forum. <br /><br />Just to be clear I don&#039;t know what powers J-mod has. I just want to kick cheaters. I guess J-mod has that access.<br /><br />

				I play with him quite often on the server, he is an active player. In addition he seems to be a nice guy (who tries to reach my kpd&nbsp; :D)<br />Good luck, Ezergecer!

				I saw the ranks and now i&#039;m convinced that there is no way to reach your guys scores so at least try to reach your kpd&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Thank you for the comment.

				I dont quite see how telling us your cs2d skills will help at all in your application, moderating has nothing to do with kpd, skills and such.<br /><br />Eitherway I&#039;ve watched you in other servers which I moderate and you seem like a decent guy, plus the server is needing extra moderators due to the inactivity of others.<br /><br />You might have to wait a couple of weeks to get a veredict, the responsible staff for the applications are inactive this past months.<br /><br />Good luck.
