				Hello everyone, my name is Tom (known as care), I&#039;m 20 years old, I&#039;m graphic designer, coming from Poland, my USGN is 60616 and I&#039;m applying for Mod. I&#039;m speaking 2 languages, English and Polish. My English is very good and I didn&#039;t have problem talking with someone.<br /><br />I&#039;m playing CS2D since 2005, most of time I&#039;m spending on this server like 4 hours a day and didn&#039;t get bored, because this server has just fun and friendly people :)<br />I&#039;m 89 on rank for now, so I guess my skill is 9/10, but better, if someone would rate me about it :)<br />My mapping and scripting skills are low, because I didn&#039;t do this stuff earlier, but I can try mapping as well, because I&#039;m creative and have many ideas :)<br /><br />Now you will ask me why would you accept me? Well, mainly I want try to help people with problems and banning hackers, because they are so annoying. I&#039;m trying to do my best.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and rate this application :)<br /><br />care `
