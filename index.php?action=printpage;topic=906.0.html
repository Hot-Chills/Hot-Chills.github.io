				This doesn&#039;t even make sense!<br /><br />Your are learning English right? So why exactly are you coming to &quot;communities&quot; that require you to speak/write English fluently? And when we correct you for your mistake you say &quot;I am learning it yet&quot;. I mean, seriously?<br /><br />As I said, my vote is NEGATIVE<br />

				You haven&#039;t changed a bit. You can&#039;t change yourself in just 1-2 weeks. There&#039;s not even a single positive vote for you. You&#039;re rejected.
