				I wanted to say i&#039;m leaving this community because mostly guys don&#039;t like me because i&#039;m dumb and stupid. So i&#039;d better leave. I&#039;ve got insulted by some guys but i&#039;ll not say their names cause I do not want to bring them trouble. Hope you&#039;ll be happy without me and hope i&#039;ll not be pest of troubles anymore.

				@TheBosSi I wanted really to leave because I felt and I knew that I wasn&#039;t able to endure that insulting. I think I need some time to change my minds. I really don&#039;t care much about simple insultings. But, you know - it&#039;s terrible to hear, that your girlfriend is shemale and you&#039;re boob and pshycho yourself :P .<br /><br />

Firstly I was so sad and full of anger, that I was ready to start hacking as for revenge (that shows how weak and fool I am) because i really know much things about hacking and I was using my information to catch hacking players. I wanted to use hacking to tease that players, whom insulted me. Their banning would be useless, because I know much tricks with IP&#039;s. <br /><br />Now I understood, that I was stupid, that I wanted to hack and revenge some guys because they insulted me. I&#039;m not really decided what to do - leave or stay. I would like to stay, of course, but how do I know - maybe same mods will start to insulting me again and I do not want to even meet them.<br /><br />Yours, Bounty

				Idiots. Yes, I said it. Bounty, he didn&#039;t try to insult/humiliate you, he said so, he said his opinion about this situation. Semih, don&#039;t get into a flame war. What&#039;s the problem? I don&#039;t know. Don&#039;t be oversensitive Bounty. If you wish to leave, go ahead - do it. But imo, it&#039;s not a reason to leave our community - it&#039;s a problem that can be solved. I&#039;m not saying goodbye just yet, because I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll get back to your senses and do the right thing.<br /><br /><br />And guys, (Semih and Oxoby) stop bothering him. I mean for reals, what did he ever do to you both? So what that he&#039;s a little immature, that&#039;s not a reason to make fun of him. (If that&#039;s the reason anyways...)
