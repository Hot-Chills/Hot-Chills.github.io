				Now i will be rude. Just shut up. Asking me about thing which should be made before banning (did you check ping?) is like saying i am newbie and fucking retared. Questions (NOT FUCKING OPINION) like that disrespect me. I play too long this fucking game to distinguish hacker and lagger.

				How are you guys so sure he wasn&#039;t hacking? It&#039;s not like Maciek will lie to us, but Maciek if you really forgot check his ping or something you can tell us, we (at least I) won&#039;t blame you. Mistakes happen.<br />

				His ping was normal. He stopped on wall cause he didnt react that fast, then he tick it off. He didnt name like that. He had another name but he is too stupid to change USGN. So:<br />He had normal ping<br />He had another name<br />He didnt change/switch off USGN<br />He was 100% speedhacking.

He has his own living style. I like it. I try to be nice and gentle with all people but I don&#039;t always desperately try to look or act like others.

				The point is if you let him play hes gonna use hacks but not speedhack. I cought him at &quot;training&quot;. He didnt hack before. He just downloaded it to try and now if we ub him he will use hacks smarter. For example ESP hack (shows enemy hp), radar, (sometimes) aimbot ( i <del>know</del> knew a lot of players who were aimboting as well ass nobody could know. I saw him speedhacking and i wouldnt ub him. But, well.. I wont be mod or anything any more so you can do what ever you want.
