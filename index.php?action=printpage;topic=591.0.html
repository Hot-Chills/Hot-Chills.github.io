				How to hide Your IP? I know, that many members in this community knows how to do it. But maybe someone don&#039;t? So i&#039;ll write it.<br />You can use Tor Browser. My location now is Swedland, because I used it :D<br />Links:<br />https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en<br />https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en<br /><br />

With no prior knowledge on what you&#039;re getting into, I don&#039;t suggest you try and surf with Tor. That&#039;s just a bad idea.

				Ye, you also can change your ip with browser plugins (such as ZenMate and many more) or with VPN sites. But how to change ip, for exapmle, in game?&nbsp; ???

And that only works when your ISP allows it and only via modem since routers are assigned their own IPs. Doing that won&#039;t change your Ip&#039;s range to a very different one, it&#039;ll only flush your current one and select another one within it&#039;s range from a pool of IPs from your ISP. It won&#039;t have much of an effect. VPNs and proxies completely hide your IP by tunneling your through their IPs, this is how most hackers come back even when they&#039;re IP banned. And I suggest that you guys don&#039;t use proxy/vpns since it&#039;ll make your connection to the servers bad. (unless ofcourse you own some high speed internet)

				*double facepalm* <br />Unfortunately my family doesn&#039;t need facepalm because they&#039;re not ignorant like you. You barely know what you&#039;re showing and saying. Let me educate you. <br /><br />IPs in game will automatically change to which proxy/VPN you&#039;re using. The method you give does not change the IP like a proxy or VPN does. Hope I&#039;m clear enough and since I wrote it easy you might understand it. (Hopefully)
