				Alright, fellas. <br />In this topic i&#039;m gonna talk about the recent and upcoming events of my life.<br />Long story short, i&#039;m quitting Counter-Strike 2D. <br />No, not forever. <br /><br />The reason behind this is that i recently finished university and in most of the countries there is a thing called &quot;<strong><em>conscription</em></strong>&quot;. <br />In other words, it&#039;s the enlistment of people in military service. <br />For example: i&#039;m over 18 years old, i don&#039;t have a job and i don&#039;t study, the country finds these people and tells them to join the army. And sadly, i&#039;ve become one of those. <br /><br />In the end of summer i submitted documents to another university to study for a Master&#039;s degree, but while they were reviewing my documents i got a letter from the recruitment department which said i need to serve in the military. After some days of frustration i decided to withdraw my documents from the university and go to the recruitment department.<br /><br />I passed the medical examination (those are not really exams, they just check your body and health), got all the documents i need, and they told me that i&#039;m pretty healthy. <br /><br />On the 28th of September they told me that i have like 20 free days before leaving my city. <br />So i enjoyed the hell out of them. <br />I legit woke up every day at 12 pm, ate as much as i want, played video games till it&#039;s evening, watched YouTube, some movies, series, listened to music, hanged out with my best friends and visited many relatives. <br /><br />And now it&#039;s time for me to say good bye. <br />I didn&#039;t think this would happen, but as it seems, life wants to test me :) <br />I&#039;m really thankful to this community for accepting me the way i am. From the first day of being a part of this group i was really happy and excited. I met a lot of awesome people, played for sooo long, achieved my goal (1st rank, huehuehue) and had a really good time. <br /><br />I can&#039;t express myself how thankful to all of you i am.<br /><strong>Thank you</strong> Happy Camper, for all the cool work, for keeping up the site, server, community. (And my SMod, lel)<br /><strong>Thank you</strong> Turkey and Bounty Hunter, for accepting me as a mod.<br /><strong>Thanks</strong> to everyone else i spent time with, you people cheer me up :)<br /><br />I enjoyed to be a part of you all.<br />I will visit the site if i&#039;ll have internet there, but i doubt that i&#039;ll be able to play. <br />I&#039;m also changing my nickname to Maloo, i just like it :)<br /><br />I wish you all good luck and i hope that when i come back, you all will be here, supporting the community.<br /><br />Stay strong, stay sexy and get laid :)<br /><br />Hyorgh out.<br /><br />(http://reactiongifs.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/big-lebowski-deal-with-it.gif)

				Maloo. In my eyes, you&#039;re a highly appreciated member of our community and without any doubt I can say that this place will definitely feel like it&#039;s missing someone important. I always admired your dedication and I&#039;m disappointed to see you go. Take care. Don&#039;t you dare not come back. :p<br /><br />P.S. This sort of thing happens in my country as well. And personally, I think it&#039;s just unfair. More so that you were going to continue your studies. Well, all I can say is, stay positive!

				Hi all, been a while since I came here. (In institute pursuing undergrad). Once in a while I come on the forums and this time I read about the conscription of Hyorgh and just want to say a few words. We all know he has done a terrible job being a moderator at HC//Fun and we all appreciate it. I have seen him play and he sure is a great player.<br />Long story short, we&#039;ll miss you HYORGH and wish that you return to this game not as soon as possible but in peace (i.e. when you have time to play cs2d without any tensions of life)<br />Of course, I do hope that we will be meeting you in the due course of time either in-game or on the forums.<br />Wish you good luck for your endeavors.<br />With deep respect and a little bit of sting in my heart<br />Regards<br />Sid (a.k.a &quot;Griff&quot;)
