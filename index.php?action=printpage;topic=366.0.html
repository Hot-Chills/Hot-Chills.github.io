				Finally i am member, so.. Its your problem shark.. You should just ignore players whos behaviour is so childish.. Its just .. STUPID.. Nickname is like a signature, i am especially sensitive about things like that . If i meet somone who copy you, during you play, i will be killing him, slappin, unabling him to move, do everything i can to make him tired about that ( cannot ban yet ). But reporting things like that wont help. Just ask mod if there are any in game to kick players who are doing such a annoying things.

				You know you can&#039;t really punish such people fairly. You either punish them hard for almost nothing, or you don&#039;t punish them at all.

				But in this situation what would you do? Banning them for taking other player nick aint good idea.. But if for example, you are in game with sharky and someone copies his nick and makes him raging, what would you do? I would tell to this guy to change nick name (warn) or i am gonna make something with him, like what i said ^up<br /><br />But when that situation happend what would you do? (i am waiting patiently for ur anserw, its gonna be some kind of lessons for me to dont abuse my powers)

				I personally wouldn&#039;t let it get that far.<br />If I clearly saw that Shark Boy&#039;s faker was teasing and offending him, I would instantly mute and/or change his name.<br /><br />If it got to the point where it was an all-out flame ware I&#039;d mute both and change the faker&#039;s name. If the mute time would end and they would carry on I&#039;d repeat for a longer period of time.
