				Heyho,<br /><br />So when I woke up this morning, thinking about how I should be studying for my final exams, I figured I should try and reach 500 kills on the server without disconnecting.<br /><br />6,5 hours (and at least 10 banned cheaters) later I finally scored my 500th kill. <br /><br />For a little while I played with bots and I was getting dozen of kills so quick I thought I&#039;d get to 500 way faster. Then it started getting slow. The more bored I got, the fewer kills I made. There was a period after 400 kills when my K/D was around 0.1 for an hour I think. :D<br /><br />Anyone ever did something like this? Anyone wanna go for 1000 with me sometime this summer? (I&#039;m over my exams in less than a week :D)<br /><br />Before anyone of you consider calling me a no-lifer, please keep in mind that I died at least 406 times today and I&#039;m still here! I have plenty life.<br /><br />PS: I hope I successfully uploaded the screenshot, check the activity log in the background :P

				haha you guys are insane :D<br /><br />For me to reach 1500 kills I would have to be up all night killing bots. Getting it against players, no chance. I would need to get some skills first :D
