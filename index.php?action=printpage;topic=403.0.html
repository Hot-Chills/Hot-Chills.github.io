				I think all the community know that i have been banned by moderator so i request the moderator and the admins to unban me and if anyone see me using any kind of hack you can ban at the spot.

				I haven&#039;t seen this guy play and I&#039;m not going to support him just because he&#039;s from the same country I am, but things seem a bit off here. Physcologicaly this guy is claiming too many times that he&#039;s not a hacker, and he knows how strict this community is about hacking and asked for a mod apply and a chance, why would a hacker keep doing that if he&#039;s exploited? If he&#039;s an idiot he might do that, otherwise he&#039;s just being honest and is in a state of confusion, I haven&#039;t seen him play, but coming from two smods means it&#039;s serious but sometimes it can be wrong too. Im not supporting his mod application, but all he wants to do is play on the server.&nbsp; It won&#039;t hurt to urban him and have a close eye on him. Because in the end, banning him will be easy, therefore if he&#039;s caught hacking you can easily ban him. I&#039;d like to see this guy play too, as from his experience he seems Like a good player. That&#039;s my opinion, sorry for errors it hard to type on a touchscreen Dx
