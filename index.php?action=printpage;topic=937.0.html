				@Bounty Hunter @EleCtroN Sorry guys, I&#039;m from FRANCE and in france 15/2 Means that i&#039;ll almost have 16 years old.<br /><br />I though that in english that was the same but seems not, so sorry for my mistake, hope you understood.<br /><br />@N&#039; I really play 24/7, That means (for me) that i wake the morning, i put my PC ON, i stay on it for like 1 hours then i run go take my breakfast then, I play on Cs2D server since i got sleep (this is only on Hollidays) :D<br /><br />I Don&#039;t if you trust me, But feel free and think what you want :) it&#039;s your choice to choose what you want to trust and what you won&#039;t trust :)<br /><br />Anyway, Have a good day! :D<br />And enjoy
