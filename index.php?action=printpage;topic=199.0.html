				You found the log, now could you be so kind and also specify the date on which you were banned. Also, it had to have been some SMod/Admin since you were first pinned to the rank Guest, then banned.

				In that Log I see my nick and oxxxymirons, too. Means I was Smod at this time.<br /><br />It was me who was going to spectator mode and me who joined terrorist forces after you got banned. I think it was me who banned you, but I really cant remember the circumstances...<br /><br />I do NOT ban a person for just saying &quot;are you blind&quot; or something like that :D Noone has done such silly bans on HC. I must have seen you using radar or aimbot, i guess. On the other hand you do not sound and talk like a hacker, so I could be wrong with that ban...<br /><br />Give him another try, maybe I banned you for nothing. You sound like a nice player, not like a hacker.<br /><br />Chilla_Girl

				Are you completely sure it was the 18th?<br />The server log showed that you played on that day with the name &quot;bulkde&quot; , but did not get banned nor did you say anything like &quot;must be blind&quot; .<br />We will keep investigating the case, but additional information would be welcome (your timezone or anything you think could be useful).<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Thanks Happy for figuring this one out. Since timezones differ it was already 19th of June according to the server when you were banned. And it seems like Chilla banned you for speedhacking.<br />If Chilla confirms that the ban was an error on his part, then I will unban you.

				So, Mr. Bonzo, please unban him. But a little warning, if it turns out we were mistaken about this decision and we see your usgn id using a single hack, you wont get a 2nd chance ;)<br /><br />But I really belief I was just wrong, so have fun playing! :)<br />
