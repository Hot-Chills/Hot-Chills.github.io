				I am not sure if this was a question for me or for everyone? I will try to answer any way.<br /><br />I have almost exclusively used Linux for scripting, mostly because it&#039;s the OS I use every day and it has good support for many script languages. Windows is nearly as good, though. It&#039;s mostly a matter of taste.

				For a website I would recommend that you choose a CMS (Content Management System). Some popular ones are Drupal, Joomla and Wordpress. There are lots of functionality and plugins for all of them. They all require a database, though.

				For a website you will need to learn HTML5 and CSS3. On top of that for basic page functions as you stated to be made from scratch (which isn&#039;t hard at all) you will need to learn PHP. You can find many books and online tutorials on PHP and web designing. Start with HTML and CSS, when you&#039;re done learning designing move on to PHP for functions like that. And while you learn PHP make use of mySQL, which is a database container.<br /><br />To make functions like you suggested PHP is required, to use and output the results of your PHP code you need a PHP/Mysql/Apache environment such as Wamp or XAMPP. Either way you can find tons of tutorials and books about getting started. Good luck.
