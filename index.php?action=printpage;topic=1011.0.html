				Greetings!<br /><br />Well, I got demoted for inactivty and I am still not really active, but active enough on the server that I see how many players are breaking rules. At least today in 1 hour, 2 hacker and more spammer joined the server. I would like to force these players who break minor rules to avoid this behaviour after this and for a longer time.<br /><br />So I would like to request a permanent Moderator rank on your server. Not the SMod rank, only the Mod rank(JMod, <strong>Mod</strong>, SMod).<br /><br />I am not sure wheather it&#039;s possible, but it would be still usefull while I&#039;m playing.<br /><br />Cheers and a nice evening!

				We can&#039;t give you a permanent MOD rank for now. Now don&#039;t get me wrong. You&#039;re a good moderator. Maybe you can get a permanent SMod rank if you were a SMod. But permanent JMod or Mod, not a chance. I would suggest you to go for SMod first. (Not permanent)<br /><br />Btw, even if you lose your rank due to inactivity because of any reason. I can still promote you back anytime.

However, I think making you SMod is not a bad idea anyway (but before that, I&#039;m interested what other admins think).
