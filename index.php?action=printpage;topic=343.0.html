				As you all know aVocado is baning me over and over.. <br />And the REASON (http://s15.postimg.org/n5qyhx3cr/Untitled2.png) for ban is: &quot;elvadas is ddossing serv&quot;<br />My name is not elvadas..&nbsp; &gt;:(<br />Im Evaldas.<br /><br />And if i ddosing server so why i didnt crashed this project after shity 20+ bans?<br />Im not doing this shit. And i think its you who is doing this all the crap. because then the server crashing u always comming from nowhere..<br />I think he trying to provoke me.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />P.s he started baning me, after few mins then i rejected one kid to join my group. Maybe it was you? He sayed he have my udp flooder and UDP Unicorn. Thats how he is dosing. and i saw he didnt used vpn.(<em>How i can see that? Ping was GREEN</em>)So please Check logs, remove him from admins, and unban me.&nbsp; :P<br />Or do what u want, just i would be happy if someone would reply. <br /><br />And as always sorry for bad english. :]

				Well, if i have mod i would ban you too everytime you join server. DDOS attacks are mainly your foult. I think you were one of pioneers of ddosing. You send knowledge to many players about this. You are not cool guy ;/

				If he was ddosing the server, he would keep changing his ip and coming back to ddos it. Since he came here asking/reporing the situation where he keeps getting banned I dont think he&#039;s the one ddosing it.<br /><br />Maciek, just because something happens/occurs more frequently when someone is present doesnt mean he&#039;s doing it.<br /><br />Also we&#039;ve (me and other mods) watched evaldes closely for a while and we were pretty sure he wasnt the one ddosing the server at the time (which was about 1-2 months ago).

Then i stoped (I dont remember reason why i stoped I think i maked promise or sth.) After that then i stoped doing it i gave my server(infected computers) to other people, its was Infinity clan member.(just for few months) After few weaks i started crashing servers again,(But this server wasnt in target list) and after dosing and ddosing, people started to creating threads about HackersClub actyviti ant other shit, and i started to think: &quot;If some day i will go to jail.. Maybe i could do something else in free time&quot; So i stoped it, and I started to creating tools such as: UDP-LP, UDP, TCP, SYN, HTTP GET, HTTP SLOWLORIS, and others.<br />now some people just copying my nickname and dosing servers, because they know if someone will be punished, its will be me, because eweryone know i can do this and that nickname.. And ofc they copying me nickname then posting faked messages/urls/emails to forums.<br /><br />Remember this after posting something: im not God. Im human.. So sometimes i can do mistakes.. Afcorse im sorry about that i did..<br /><br />Sorry for talking shit, today im very drunk.. and afcourse as always sorry for bad english&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />If someone need, my email is: WinterWhite@Programmer.NET Im not using GMail or other crap. :]

				Nah, he wasnt ddosing. I am sure he wasnt ddosing, and i would ban evaldas too. Cause of him ddosing became more popular, he was giving his tools to other players etc. If avo tried to remvoe that guy i think he wasnt ddoser but innocent victim. He tried to remvoe Evalad and another guy, dont remember name. Evaldas always was connected with ddosing :) and some thing like that(he like to do programs and things like this :D)

We&#039;re all gods, aren&#039;t we?<br /><br />Plus, just a a quick note to you, Evaldas, since it seems you like having attention, your reputation makes people BAN you, it seems pretty clear, doesn&#039;t it? Your smart enough to know it too, so its not the reason you wrote this topic.
