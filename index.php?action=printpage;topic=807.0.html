				1) USGN ID : 108613, I had my older USGN ID 82703. But i&#039;m playing with this one(108613)<br />&nbsp;<br />2) In-game name. Ke[N]o<br /><br />3) How active you can/will be. I can be active 1-2 hours per day<br /><br />4) Have you had any prior experience as a moderator? Yes. I had moderator experience in BG server,also i had many clans i moderate(citylife,happy town...)<br /><br />5) Why exactly do you want to be a Mod/SMod ?<br />I want to be Mod or SMod(If possible Mod) because of two reasons.<br />First one is I played on HC Fun server.I started to like that server,and I played everyday on it.Peoples are very friendly on it.My dream is to became Mod or Smod(if possible MOD) on HC Fun server.Of first time i join it that is my dream.So I wait some time and make apply for Mod.I am very active on HC Fun,of my 1/2-3 time on cs2d i spend playing HC Fun for me that is best server i ever played on.Also it&#039;s very popular server.Also script on server suprised me.<br />Second reason because HC Fun is popular server sometimes hackers come to server(speedhack).And i want to Kick-Ban them and let all peoples play in peace , for let them having fun again.Because sometimes&nbsp; i dont see MOD&#039;s on server and they can hack even if other player votes them they dont get kicked,that usually happens when i join in 12:00-01:00 on server.<br /><br />6) *OPTIONAL* I am a guy who loves Dubstep music.I spend sometimes making Dubstep music.I also love beatbox i can do different(or produce)music from my mouths.I played counter strike 2D since 2007-2008.I am pro with m3,m4a1,awp and little bit of laser.I live in Bosnia And Herzegovina.I have 14 years.That is all for now.More about me you will learn....<br /><br />Thank&#039;s for reading application
