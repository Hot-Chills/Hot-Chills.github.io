				<strong>Short intro</strong>:<br />Hello! My nick is AREIOS. I&#039;m 20 years old from Hungary. I first played cs2d in 2011 with my classmates but I shortly became MIA. I reinstalled the game few months ago. I have been studying english for at least 10 years now but quite frankly I learned the language by playing online games, watching movies/TV shows. As to my skills ingame, my honest opinion is that I&#039;m strong average. Good players kick my ass and I can pretty much do that to newbies :)<br /><br /><strong>1) USGN ID</strong>: 84750<br /><br /><strong>2) In-game name</strong>: AREIOS<br /><br /><strong>3) How active you can/will be</strong>: I&#039;m student, facing the summer. I can be pretty active.<br /><br /><strong>4) Have you had any prior experience as a moderator?</strong> Yes. I had been a co-leader of a large gaming community for 3 years and I&#039;m currently a moderator on ares construction server.<br /><br /><strong>5) Why exactly do you want to be a Mod/SMod ?</strong> To be honest, I don&#039;t. As mentioned above, I have had my fair share of being an admin/moderator I just want to enjoy the game now. The reason I&#039;m applying is quite obvious, I don&#039;t want to play with cheaters. In the last few days alone I counted a few dozen and we only managed to kick a fraction of them.<br /><br />If you approve my application you can expect me to represent the community well and follow whatever rules you have (for mods). I will focus on keeping the server clean from troublemakers but I will also stay active on the forums too.<br /><br />I had a nice chat with an admin called E[A] the other day. Can you please tell me under what alias is he hiding here on the forum?
