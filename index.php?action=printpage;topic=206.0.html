				Hello all!<br /><br />So I spend some time on server and I got some suggestions.<br /><br />1. Maybe some HPK (high ping kicker). Sometimes I&#039;m not sure if player is cheating or lagging. And server gets crazy.<br /><br />(http://s21.postimg.org/49k7kpbgn/how_about.jpg)<br /><br />2. Levels and experience points are some kind of goals but why not make it more interesting? For example: when someone make an multi kill (with RPG, Molotov, AWP, you can make it with many other weapons) he got more exp. points (20+30*x when x is number of people killed in multi kill). So if he killed 4 players with one Molotov he get 20 + 3*30 (150% of kill). <br /><br />Those are my suggestions for that moment.&nbsp; ;)

If Happy don&#039;t want create new attributes so maybe some competiton on forum? We can advertise it on server. Winner will recieve special rank on forum (maybe &quot;Attribute competition winner&quot;) and some experience points in game. I think it can be good.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Da boss</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Good suggestions Dnl, I just have one little thing to say about your 1st suggestion in which maybe a speed detector could be added to the server instead of just kicking the people a mod could say a command that tells him about the speed of the player so he can be sure if the guy is hacking or not.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks and I think your suggestion is awesome.

				Heh, my (gray and unfortunate) brain cells did good today and I came up with an idea of my own.<br />You know these construction rounds where you start off with a shield?<br />Well I have a rather simple idea to spice them up. I think it would be great, if the supply would also offer chainsaws.<br />Great fun for the whole family and it also makes the shields a bit more useful.

There would be no need for m4a1 and other gunz so... Maybe a new round?
