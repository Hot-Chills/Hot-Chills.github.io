				Deus you are going on my nerves... Every 2nd comment you are posting makes other people feeling sad or &quot;not so good as you&quot;. I was on the server playtime nearly 6 days, i surely banned over 70 hackers. and 5 or 6 only the last 3 days. I dont like the way how you treat those other people. Please dont be so offending, I saw a lot of mods these days online, and even if a mod can only visit 10 minutes per day, he shows presence. Please think about that. I am not offending you or trying to say what you should do, just think ;)

				Chilla. IDC. If you are active like this, why i cant see you at the server? And why Maciek says (the nolifer player) that hackers in the server, without mods? I didnt say that im better than the others. Just im visiting sometimes the server. Deal with that.

				KK, i say it first...<br /><br />I&#039;d like to put forward Maciek as Mod. Everyone has his pros and cons, every human being. Of course, Maciek was rude to players and mods. I still disklike the &quot;owned&quot; slogan. But even after he was banned for flaming and insulting, he came to this forum and asked to play again. Now he is playing very much.<br /><br />He says he doesn&#039;t like that others call him hacker, because everyone will think its the truth, and his name is a symbol for hacking even though he doesnt&#039;t hack! I think we should try it out, he is so active and reports so many hackers.<br /><br />I know i will find supporters for this idea. <br /><br />Love, Chilla_Girl

				If everyone claims you are a hacker, then after some time everyone will THINK you are a hacker, but they dont even know you or saw you playing. Thats what you said yesterday, so I decided never to call someone hacker for fun again ;)

				Maciek I see a lot of reports here so cautious me needs to say that no mod should see the names here and immidiately ban them, please be careful guys watch the reported one then swing the hammer. A ban isn&#039;t just a toy, you need to be sure first!

I&#039;m actually happy for your reports, all I meant was when the mod sees a name familiar in-game because <strong>you</strong> reported it he shouldn&#039;t immidiately ban just give it a minute of watching then if you&#039;re sure ban.<br /><br />Reporting a hacker is actually a good thing which I&#039;ll always like. When we (mods) see names here we can relate this into the game and detect famous hackers easily because they were reported before.<br /><br />Btw next time don&#039;t asssume I&#039;m against you, I cleared my point in my earlier comment but you looked at it from one side only, I&#039;m actually liking this topic lol.
