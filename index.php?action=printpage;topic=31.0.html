				I have been doing some small script updates during the last few days:<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Foul language is now censored and the player is slapped. Unfortunately, this has caused spamming among dead and spectating players, who can&#039;t get slapped. I might have to do something about that.</li><li>CS2D 0.1.2.2 made it possible to use multiple colours in text. I have used that to make the chat lines more readable. Tags are drawn in a separate colour, for instance.</li><li>A few new rounds were added and a few modified. DC changed the behaviour of barricades, which made a few tweaks necessary. It also opened up new possibilities.</li></ul>

				Welcome Ken. :)<br /><br />Also when it comes to barricades, I kinda like them better now. They used to be pretty useless except for that you could build them extremely fast. Now they serve as actual barricades, slowing down anybody with the intention to pass through them.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Eugh, why does my session always time out while trying to post anything. :&lt;

				We need a Anti Spam System, Anti Speed Hack System (You can Enable/Disable auto kick,<br />Also when a Speed Hack detected a message will appear with the name of the hacker so Mods can check if the Player is really using Speed Hack in rounds without speed).<br /><br />That&#039;s all for now :3

				I have implemented an anti speed hack system for a clan so I know it is possible. The only thing I didn&#039;t manage was to filter out people moving through portals, which will cause false detections in rounds using portals or portal guns. Of course, turning off the detection during those rounds might work.<br /><br />My fear, though, is that too many advanced functions will cause lag. I don&#039;t quite see that speed hacking is such a big problem. You are telling me it is?

				It&#039;s hard to kill speed hackers when you have no speed, and I&#039;m working on a new lua script called &quot;Game Guard&quot;, I added Anti Speed Hack and Anti Spam System and there are no Lua Errors in the dedicated server log.

				It looks really good. The numbers you used to compensate for speedmod are very close to the ones I found when testing.<br /><br />Some feedback:<br /><br />It won&#039;t work for construction games where you can build teleports or with teleport guns. It will also spam messages, one every second, when it detects a speed hacker.

				It is truly good. Given the tools that CS2D provide to us, it&#039;s impossible to make a perfect speed detection script. I remember DC writing some time that even he couldn&#039;t do it.
