				Hi, I have suggestions for HC/Fun: <br />1. I think server will be better when players can vote rounds.If they want laser and portal gun round then one player say e.g. !voteround 45+88 or !voteround laser+portal_gun, and then all players can say !yes or !no to vote...if more than 50% people on server vote yes then next round will be e.g. laser+portal...I have seen it on old server &quot;Readom Weapons by Domek&quot; where i was an Admin.I think it is not bad idea:D<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />2. Some players like laser mode(script in which the bullets bounce off the walls)...Meyby you can make one or more rounds with that&nbsp; script?<br />&nbsp;Please think about my ideas and answer as soon as possible.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MSdawid[PL]<br /><br />PS.:Sorry for my bad English...I&#039;m from another country:D (Poland)

				but u can make voteround limit: e.g.&nbsp; only once per 10 rounds... then msg: &#039;u can vote next round&#039; or somethink like that...if nobody make vote then next round will be normal...and e.g. 10 round later again can vote it<br /><br />That was really nice on Readom Weapons by Domek... players often said it was good idea and not always voted laser+super...here wasn&#039;t also voterounds limit but it worked good...

				1. Voting rounds could be nice, but there are these special people who will try to abuse this option.<br /><br />2. Wouldn&#039;t that cause tons of lags?<br /><br />3. I would appreciate a super extra round.

				Maybe if you add the voting thing you also add like a Timer so like you voted for the laser round you cant vote for it again for about 20-30 minutes or 10 rounds or something like that.

				You did it, but now &quot;Link&quot; to ranks and traffic look worse ;/ You added new options but rest suffered. I mean graphic look worse.<br />I dont know, maybe write &quot;Here&quot; instead of &quot;Link&quot; and make all of this info bigger, thicken etc? add some colours, cus whole text is grey..

				Possibly underline them to better represent them as links. All the time, not only when you&#039;re hovering your mouse above the link.<br />Changing the text to something like &#039;Here&#039; is a great idea too.<br /><br />

				Thanks for the feedback. I will make some adjustments regarding the links. I will also state that hovering the players number will show a list of the players currently on the server. That&#039;s really not obvious now.

				I have an idea. What about voting ROUNDS? If players want laser round they will press f2 and select &quot;round vote&quot;. Or if its not that good, i imagined that, Happy, you could make 5-10 rounds specially to vote. They wont be able in random round games, but they could be selected ony if players make special vote. System should work that map is picked only if 70% of players will vote (but not same map, just 70% need to vote, and wins map which has most of votes). What about this ? Its a lot of work but i think its cool, and much more players would play. <br />Also i would be in heaven if you could make sounds. Double kill! Tripple kill, Monster kill unstopable, 21 killin spree etc.<br />If you didnt understand my idea just ask, I tried to explain but i know i could make not good enough (especially about vote system but hope u will get my idea). Then just ask.
