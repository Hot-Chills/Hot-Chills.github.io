				I have an idea. Once per half year or more, Happy Camper could organize admin elections. He would make a poll and add to it SMods or other members who are good enough to be admins. Anyone could vote. Voting results would be showed only after voting. Anyone will not be able to change his vote.<br />What about it, Happy Camper?<br />Maybe my idea is stupid.

				The idea is really good in my opinion, however as the time passes the admin team could become very crowded. And well, nobody wants to remove other admins really.

				I forgot to add another thing. Before voting new admins there should be other voting, who admin must be demoted. I do not think you would like it :D<br /><br />EDIT: Our community must to be democracy :D Members must to elect their bosses, not they themselves or our dear president Mr. Happy Camper :D

				Interesting idea, although not very practical in my opinion. Having this admin rotation simply doesn&#039;t make much sense. It assumes that there are actually people ready and willing to do the job of an admin, and that they&#039;re gonna be decent at it.<br /><br />Also, a dictatorship works great. Never had any problems with it. :P

				Well, eager for result will be bigger if we&#039;ll hide results and show them <span class="bbc_u">only after</span> voting.
