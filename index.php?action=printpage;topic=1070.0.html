				Hello, It&#039;s me Valko and I&#039;m submitting a ban appeal. I used to be a Jmod in this lovely community and now I&#039;m submitting a ban appeal so let me give you a quick rundown of how it all happened. So I was as happy as could be got into a good collage and life was great. Until a big test came which as you could guess I failed. I felt really disappointed in myself and wanted a escape wanted somewhere to go somewhere where I could be better, stronger , smarter than others and that &quot;somewhere&quot; was CS2D doesn&#039;t seem that bad does it? Well as you could guess it wasn&#039;t enough I wanted to be better so I started hacking. And then one dark day I got banned I didn&#039;t really care at that time but now I do so here I am writing this ban appeal Summer is here and I wanted to go back to playing CS2D I wanted to fix my old mistakes I do promise not to commit the same mistake twice and I will try my hardest to become a worthy member of the community. Please keep in mind that I was hacking over around 1 year ago and I changed since that time period. So I hope you take unbanning me under consideration and, thank you for reading this boring appeal.<br />USGN:146203<br /><br />Kind Regards, Valko

				Well, I think he deserves another chance. He seem to be a serious guy who had bad luck in that big exam, and he started hacking. Usually the hackers are perm. baned. But that guy was JMod in HC//Fun, this is a bigger fault than being an user and hacking. I always though when you apply for JMod, and you get demoted, it&#039;s more difficult to get your old rank again. So Good Luck.
