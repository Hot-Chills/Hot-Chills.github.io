I can&#039;t prove it with an image but i&#039;ll try to explain some things.<br /><br />-It was the first kill of the round.(Its hard to believe I was camping at the beginning of round)<br />-Szabolcs Schut Lorand!!! left the game after I got killed. (A little suspicious...)<br />-Nobody said &quot;I killed you because you was camping&quot;

				Are you sure he didnt thrwo any granade or something? He left in the same time you got killed. I guess that his mines explode or something when he left. So yuo got killed by mines which had no owner

				Firstly, it can&#039;t be he got killed by a mine or whatsoever due to someone&#039;s departure because no one left before he died. It doesn&#039;t point out what killed him. This concludes to one thing in my knowledge is that someone used the &gt;kill command on him as if it was a slap it would&#039;ve said he was slapped.<br />Secondly, Szabolcs Schut Lorand!!!&#039;s departure isn&#039;t suspicious, he just rage quit. &gt;.&gt;<br /><br />This concludes that you were killed by a moderator using the <strong>kill</strong> command.
