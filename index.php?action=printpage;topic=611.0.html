				^this popped into my mind while playing a few minutes on the server, wondering how long it would take to climb up one rank, from 64 to 63. <br />I have been almost completely inactive during the last few months (or is it a year already?), and yet I am still holding rank 64. Which means, a new player, ever if s/he played with godmode activated activated, has no chance to ever reach one of the upper ranks, unless s/he decides to dedicate his/her entire freetime to cs2d. <br /><br />Now you obviously have to build up your rank&nbsp; over time, but it is completely unfair that &quot;dead accounts&quot; are blocking rungs on the ladder to rank 1.<br /><br />Therefore I suggest a monthly rank reset and a script that safes your &quot;total&quot; rank, which will also be displayed in chat when a player calls up his/her rank.<br /><br />This way the very active/skilled players would still have a chance to hold the ranks they deserve, while dinosaurs (like me) would still have their ancient ranks saved and be able to share their hoary glory with the newer top ranked rookies.<br /><br />Opinions, please? :)

				For everyone, so that every month everybody would have a new chance for a good rank. The good/active players&#039; ranks shouldn&#039;t be affected by this at all anyway (since they are good/active).<br />

				Bad idea. Everyone with good ranks will oppose this. It would be great idea to reset those player&#039;s ranks who are afk for N months.

				W/e, i will be in 3 most playing people anyway. I am afraid N&#039; will catch up with me even without this ;D If there were reset, zloy and n would take both of 1st places/. They play so much last days.

Additional monthly ranks that are also shown in chat when a player calls up his rank. Either way the total player rank would not be lost. <br /><br />Resetting only ranks of inactive players would be unfair. They &quot;worked&quot; for their ranks just as hard as the&nbsp; recently active players. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php/topic,611.msg5810.html#msg5810">Quote from: Maciek on June 26, 2014, 23:42:49</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">W/e, i will be in 3 most playing people anyway.

If zloy and N are currently the best/most active players on the server, they should get a proper rank. <br />But I did not only think of N, but also of new players who really don&#039;t have hope to ever reach one of the upper 25 ranks.
