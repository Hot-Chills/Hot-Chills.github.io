				Hey, a other guy got my old USGN because my password was to weak, he hacked on hc fun (i know it because it&#039;s the reason of &quot;my&quot; ban) years ago i think. I have this USGN back.

				You do realize that your comment is useless? btw. I don&#039;t care if i am still banned there because i don&#039;t play HC // Fun anymore. I just saw that i am banned and made an unban request. I know, you banned Mr-AnaS and not me. He stole my USGN years ago because my password was too weak. I created this signatur (http://unrealsoftware.de/profile.php?userid=115028) where Starkkz gave my old USGN back because i want that everyone knows what really happends. did the administrators check anything before posting like ŦƲƦƙɘƳ? It&#039;s like if i accept a guy as Mod and i don&#039;t check his USGN or something...

				When you do an unban-request it is you who needs to proof that you were not hacking. It is not the duty of the admin to ask several people wether your story is true. If the admin thinks that it is questionable he won&#039;t remove your ban. Neither you nor I decide that.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php/topic,1138.msg11091.html#msg11091">Quote from: Frªncis on May 19, 2017, 20:42:55</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#039;s like if i accept a guy as Mod and i don&#039;t check his USGN or something...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This would actually be the case if the admin unbans everyone without being skeptical.<br />

				It might seem fussy but it&#039;s simply not their job to do that. As I mentioned above it is the requester&#039;s task to give a proof. In your case it is you who has to ask Starkkz to write a message to an admin of HC on usgn.de where he confirms your story. [In the end it is still the decision of our admins, but they are more friendly than me].

				If the story with the USGN problem isn&#039;t true then why my USGN isn&#039;t banned for multi-accounts? If i am a hacker then why i am Mod2 in the Fws Community and why i am not banned on unrealsoftware.de for hacking? Why none of my cs2d friends know that i am a hacker? hmmmm soo many question.

Requesting a proof for being innocent is a common part of the procedure of handling an unban-request. It shouldn&#039;t offend you in any way.<br />(Btw, the questions you asked are not helpful at all. We have no proof that Starkkz knows about your USGNs. We don&#039;t know if you have friends and wether they know you as a hacker or not. In the end you wouldn&#039;t be the first hacker who was accepted as a mod. [I am not saying that you are a hacker, I am just saying that these questions are irrelevant]).<br />We do care about your request, but please be kind enough to let someone (trustworthy - like Starkkz) confirm your story.

He&#039;s an admin at DR and I&#039;ve played and moderated with him.<br /><br />I believe that his USGN was stolen like he said it was.
