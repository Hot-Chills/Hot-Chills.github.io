				Hello! I want to make an application for J-Mod.<br /><br />In-game Name: Senior Eagles<br /><br />USGN Number: 150498<br /><br />Age: 20<br /><br />I want to make a J-Mod application for HC // Fun, because it has to be the best server on CS2D, and I like it. I want to make a J-Mod application, because I want to give other admins and mods a break, and help everyone (except for cheaters, lol). So far, I did moderate some other servers, but not much. I can speak English and Croatian. I am serious about business, but when some situations call for a joke, I do joke. I do have VIP status, but I played HC // Fun about 13 hours with a USGN account, but generally, I played HC // Fun without a USGN account since 2013.<br /><br />I will be online for a bit more than 1 hour, sometimes about 2 hours.<br /><br />Thanks, written by TodaysTomorrowRT, have a nice day&nbsp; :)

				Hey Eagles, welcome on HotChills.<br />You are a nice and active player, I think you deserve a chance as moderator.<br />Of course joking is not forbidden, but since moderators are some kind of role-model they need to be a bit more serious than normal players. I am sure though that you will learn the &quot;right&quot; behaviour quickly (I hope you don&#039;t misunderstand that part :P).<br />Regards
