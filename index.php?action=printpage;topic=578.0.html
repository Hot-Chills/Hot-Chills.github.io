				1-<br />Events! There should be events on the server! It&#039;s kinda dull now with just the rounds shufflin and looping and traffic has gone down. &gt;.&gt; Events could be of any kind, such as every(somwhat) mod/admin joining the server (Although I know no one has much time but..) and playing against each other or another type of event(recommendations would be helpful), or Double XP weekend(I know its retarded, just an example tho)<br /><br />2-<br />Seasonal Maps!<br />Remember HC had one for Winter? It would be awesome if we can get a hold a mapper(or if any one of you would be willing to) and just change the overlay of dm_dust for that particular season, e.g in fall the color complexion would be warm with leaves fallen around etc.<br /><br />This can boost the traffic and lure in more players.

				I thought about normal map voting. For example, best tt or ct can start voting and if more than 50% of player vote yes, map will be changed.

				if we will change the map. owner&nbsp; must change his script , and need to create a new map for example dm_dust2 , if its will be ready we can to vote this one .<br /><br />@nighthawk, with seasonal maps its real good idea, but we need to make a &quot;Map cup&quot; where we can vote the best map.<br />about XP dont think so that its a good, cuz lvl is not depend on smth.

				Double XP weekend is a decent idea. Every mod/adm joining the server is a good idea too, though I don&#039;t think many of us will join, but who knows.

				Seasonal Maps Won&#039;t be votable. The default map will be dm_dust, in different seasons only the overlay of dm_dust will change, nothing else. I go against the map voting system. <br /><br />As for the XP thing, it was just a catalyst to get you guys started on ideas. Leveling up is just for teh fun. And an event where all(as many can join) mods/admins should be tried out, not every month, but every few months or somewhat.
