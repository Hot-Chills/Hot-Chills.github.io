				But who you want to ask? Players who are plaing 2h per month? Dudes who didnt even score more than double? There is nobody else then N&#039; whos that good to enjoy those sounds. When you hear unstopable 20 then you know &quot;fck yeah, i am good&quot; Most of mods and smod doesnt play that much. Its easy to check their places on rank. To be good, you have to practise, if you practise it means you spend a lot of time on server. There is so little active mods. I play only with them. (prolly nobody of those players use headphones to play, its really helpful to localise players)

				Its same question like &quot;whats ur kpd&quot; if player doesnt have 1,80+ he wont use it ;D Its really cool :) but.. everything from past was much better.. dunno, i am gettin older and older, anything is that cool like servers and modes from past ;/ Mode in which you level up, and get new weapons, armors in deathmatch game mode. HEs dealing dmg even if you were hidden behind wall, bugged HEs in walls oh ah;/
