				Semihlord is a childish moderator.<br />He killed me (with mod powers, not by his skills) just for changing my name to &quot;Yes he does&quot;. He abuses and mutes people without having enough reasons.<br />He acts as a 12 years old kid. I don&#039;t think he is a good moderator, he doesn&#039;t know how to behave, all time commenting about rounds, saying noob to people, he&#039;s just as annoying as a fly turning around my head.<br /><br />I just ask you to look him close. He is going to blunder soon if he keeps behaving the way he does.<br />He is very active although.<br /><br />Cheers, and forgive my english.<br /><br />Edit: spelling

I have never seen you apologizing, and you made some errors a mod shouldn&#039;t do. I&#039;ve just said that you&#039;d watch your words before writing, you are not giving a good image of the server. I&#039;ve also said other times that you&#039;re a little bit annoying, but never in bad faith, just attempting to make you see this.<br /><br />Edit: He actually seems a nice guy when talking by private, but I still think his behaviour is not the appropiate for a mod in some occasions.

				The User &quot;Say the truth means get mute&quot; connected yesterday. I asked him why he chose this name. He said he got muted before just for telling something like &quot;Semih i think you act to harsh&quot; . I have no proof whether this happend, and I have no idea what exactly he said, that he got muted.<br /><br />But he was pissed of for over a day, so I assume he felt he got muted by a wrong decision. That &quot;Kill&quot; thing deus said is a serious problem. I never kill anyone via abusing powers, else: - The person says &quot;CHILLA I LOVE YOU PLEASE SHAKE AND KILL ME &lt;3&quot; or its a bot, and there is just me playing with 5 bots. If there is even 1 other player and 4 bots, there is no right to kill by command. Only wanted to say that ;)<br /><br />I have not enough knowledge about you, semih, i cant say if you are a good mod or not. Those are just 2 points who make me feel a bit uncomfortable...

				Someone with moderator rights annoys people by changing their name to &quot;Player&quot; (or &quot;Player 2&quot;...). I think his nick was &quot;[VAK] Mael Alcatraz&quot; or &quot;Galil&quot;.
