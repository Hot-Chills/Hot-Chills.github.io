				Today is a sad day for me and for the CS2D community. I just found out that Kenpachi, my long time friend and the hoster of Fws and HC has passed away.<br /><br />First time I met him was in 2010 when he played at HC // Construction for a while. His speciality was AWP sniping, which he was very good at. After I closed down my server I still bumped in to him on other servers. We had a lot of interesting talks. Some time later he started Fws. I played on the servers and helped him out with some scripting. When I opened HC // Fun he generously offered to host it.<br /><br />Even though I never met him in real life, I know he was a friendly and generous person.<br /><br />Good bye my friend. Thanks for everything. You will be missed.<br /><br />http://fwsserver.forumotions.net/t3717-kenpachi-passed-away<br />http://www.unrealsoftware.de/forum_posts.php?post=400165

				Oh God, that is really sad. <br />I know this is inappropriate to ask such things but why did he pass away? Did he have some kind of a disease?

				If I remember correctly he said that he had some personal problems at the start of 2015 and was in the hospital. My sincere condolences to his family, may his soul rest in peace.
