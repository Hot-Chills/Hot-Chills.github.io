				Hey guys. <br />My name is Vova, i&#039;m a 20 years old guy from Ukraine.<br />Some of you may know me as GRP or S1mple.<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Game Info:</span></strong><br />I have been playing CS2D since 2009 and i don&#039;t regret spending these years on my favourite game.<br />I was really active till Autumn 2013, joined |fruit|, played every day, had a lot of fun, but then the situation in my country got really tense (Revolution 2013-2014, Russia intervened Ukraine and so on). I wasn&#039;t playing till the second half of 2015. As you know, a lot of servers are gone and less and less people are playing CS2D, so i started playing on HC // Fun. I really love the server, got ranked up, more and more people recognize me and it just feels good. Oh yeah, thanks to the |fruit| clan, i really improved my aim, tactics and strategy of the game, so i consider myself as a more or less skilled player.<br /><strong>Current ingame nickname: </strong>Hyorgh<br /><strong>USGN ID:</strong> 43558<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Personal Info:</span></strong><br />Shy guy, no gf, car and music fan. Professional procrastinator since 2012. <br />I&#039;m currently on my fourth year in university (Bachelor&#039;s degree), studying for an English-Ukrainian interpreter.<br />My level of English is Upper-Intermediate. <br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Reason of this application:</span></strong><br />As i mentioned before, i do like the server. But lately, a lot of hackers have been messing around and this really pisses me off. Players can votekick them, but that won&#039;t do much, as the ban time is only 1 hour. Yet, many&nbsp; hackers just quit and rejoin before they&#039;re banned, so it becomes an endless loop of votekicking. Most of the hackers don&#039;t login, so it&#039;s hard for simple players to report them, as they have no info about them.<br />I&#039;ve been able to speak with one of the hackers and he said that he changes his IP with a VPN.. <br />Basically, i want to become a Mod (any mod) to get the ability to check their info while they&#039;re on the server, and then report or ban them.<br /><br />I&#039;m online every day. Denis a.k.a N`, knows me personally and he has been doing a great job cleaning the server while we were playing. Now, Denis is probably busy cuz i haven&#039;t seen him in a while.<br /><br />I hope i&#039;ll become somehow useful for your server.<br /><br />Thank you for reading this. Looking forward to your replies.

				Postive, he&#039;s an active and rational player who obey the rules. Only let it be with your pranks...&nbsp; :o<br /><br /><br />P.S.: You&#039;re only able to ban hackers as SMod, as JMod, you&#039;re able to kick, mute and kill player only.

				At times like these, when the moderator team is quite inactive (at least most of them are), I think I can make an exception and instantly promote you to a Mod, so you could at least make 24 hour bans. I will contact you personally about how can you make them perm-banned. So yeah, accepted.
