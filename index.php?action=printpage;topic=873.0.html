				Title: <strong>Language rule</strong><br />

				Hello,<br /><br />This suggestion about a possible new rule. It happens quite often that two or even more players speak the same language (apart from english) and they choose to do so in the main chat.<br /><br />For someone who doesn&#039;t speak that language it looks like nonsense, right? And if it was nonsense, it would be considered spam, which is not allowed. Following that logic I would suggest to add a rule to the server info that says something like &quot;Speak only english in the main/general chat&quot;.<br /><br />There is a pm function to which (as far as I know) everyone have access.<br /><br />In case it is already a rule, please make it visible because its obviously not clear for the average player and we can&#039;t refer to them as easilly as &quot;Press F1&quot;.<br /><br />Since our set of rules are written in english, there are players who wouldn&#039;t understand this new rule and therefor not knowing they are breaking it. For those there is not much to do other than warning, eventually muting and hoping he/she gets the point. In my opinion its more important that most players are not annoyed with full-screen nonsense than a few player&#039;s privilige to using their mother tongue.<br /><br />Obviously one or two line from any language is not an issue, I&#039;m talking about long conversations.<br /><br />What do you think?

				My opinion is that players have right to speak their language unless it&#039;s a spam. If they&#039;re talking too much ( :D ), I&#039;d say to them to speak in PM.
