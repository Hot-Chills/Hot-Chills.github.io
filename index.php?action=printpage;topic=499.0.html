				Hiya. First don&#039;t know if this is right section or not excuse me please, but want to report that moderator. Here is the situation.<br />3-4 people got killed by mines in a round. Then i typed around 5 times &quot;:D&quot; becouse it was hilarious. And he muted me without reason or even simple warining, probably becouse he hates me, i killed him couple rounds before. He should not be mod i think. Thanks.

Probably 7 <strong>but that&#039;s not the point</strong>. It seems that you don&#039;t understand when you need to mute someone.You should mute people when they are really spaming for no reason, like all of your screen is blocked by words etc. First you need to make warn, then mute. And not for 1h. And what i did? Just &quot; : D&quot;. Yep i will say it again, you was angry cuz i killed you 1vs1 with sniper near water, but you wont remember that. And yes your not impossible to kill if you think that : )

				@Maciek: that depends on how long you mute a person. A mute for 1 minute is a warning, a mute for 1 hour is a serious punishment; which is, as Turkey already said, a bit too much for seven simple smileys. One hour was no appropriate punishment if nothing else happened.

				@Turkey,AceShot I&#039;m not afraid. if you want you can demote&nbsp; me. but I believe that the server needs the discipline and not for every action Post complain. it is not permissible. players need to know that there are moderators, and there must be order. or I lost my mind? I&#039;m sorry, AceShot. but the next time I will act decisively bring order to the server, which would not be worth it to me, even demoting. I have experience and I know what I&#039;m doing when I decided that it needed an hour to mute - then it should be!!!<br /><br />what about warning.thanks to him, on the server and will be happening chaos, because for a long time there was no specific violations. and now there are only small and that violations may be punished with only a warning. that would avoid this need to scare players like me once Deus year ago muted for 69 years. he was a good moderator . so i hope that u hear me <br /><br />N`

It explains what I meant by this action. First you should warn, or mute 1-5, maybe even 10 minutes. But not a hour. It&#039;s just a warning, it could affect your rank in the future (I mean if you&#039;ll abuse or smth), but for now your rank is completely safe. Chill. 8)<br /><br />Turkey

				A lot of fun :D Even without mod powers i can kick you. Crowd will listen to player #1 and we will vote kick you every time XD I will defend my bro N&#039; and every his decision is good.

We spend a lot of time playing here and we know when to mute and for how long. And AceShot made from himself somebody on who i (maybe other N friends) will &quot;abuse&quot; (not sure, about muting - is it abuse?) powers)<br />Make a post cause somebody mute you on 1h, its RIDICULOUS. He has some mental problems or i dont know. Its just funny to punch those nobs and makes them angry ;D<br /><br /><br />AceShot »VIP«: N i hope u got ur lesson :) this one made me insanely mad ;D

				Just tell me its not a truth. Even if i specially ban somebody and he will report me, they want demote me. Now, maybe they will but i really dont care. There is lack of mods and always will be. I told it only to show him who is better, more important etc. Wanted to prove him that he is ridiculous. Tell me if i made something (dont count this one) wrong. I was doing my best till this retarded (MENTALLY RETARDED) player appear. Mute for 1h and he makes topic like it is perma ban, damn<br /><br />ah, destroy. I am mature when its possible. Trust me..

				I remember the Derpinzz guy he was like: &quot;I am better than you Maciek!&quot; etc. but now you are not even different than him, you have to accept that you acted abusive, Aceshot didn&#039;t deserve any of these.<br />You muted him, laughed, unmuted him, messed with him more and when he told you that you will be reported, you muted him again.<br />And for the records, you kinda did the same in Derpinzz, I told you to ignore him but everytime you killed him you wrote &quot;owned&quot; or some other thing.

				I dont even care. I already said, remove it. It doesnt bring me anything but fact they cannot vote me. I am still being called hacker, but now they cannot do anything to this. You can even pernamently ban me, it would be a favor. I shouldnt play that much. For you &quot;hitlers&quot; are shits, its a childish behaviour. Its serious thing, he was killing and using my fathers (Polish poeple). Those people were fighting against him and for you its a shit. Good to know you dont have anything like respect, respect for history and mass deaths. But the childish one is me ( i am chilshis when ever i want, i like to behave like that jsut for fun) but you are saying such a thing seriously.

				@Apfelbrot, @CyrusDeVirus - Thank you for pointing the true and obvious (if i miss anyone sry). With my bad english i couldn&#039;t express myself better.<br />I&#039;m really glad in what direction are things right now.<br />Those 2 players showed their real face. And it&#039;s ugly. And i&#039;m sure it can go even worst. They act as childs/trolls, not like mods and they will be always like that. I believe everyone can and will confirm that they do not deserve to be in that position. For me the problem is solved. Last word have the administrators and let they do whatever they want i am sure it will be the right decision. Thanks.<br />
