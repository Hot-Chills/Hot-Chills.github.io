				<strong>1) Breif Introduction:</strong><br /><br />greetings to all, my name is Neuen and my CS2D Name is Neo &amp; NeoWeY. I&#039;m 16 years old, my U.S.G.N Account id is 93568 and I it would be a pleasure to be administrator to help this huge community.<br /><br /><strong>2) Personal information:</strong><br /><br />I was born in a small town called almafuerte in Cordoba (argentina) and Because of familiar problems pass to live in Buenos Aires (Argentina) ... I live with my father and brother, I spend some time with friends so also I go to school in the morning. I can write in both English and Portuguese (Portuguese only what I learned playing on their servers, NOT IN SCHOOL). and just in case , I&#039;m working on new projects for the game , they can see in my USGN account.<br />I think that provides good information so far.<br /><br /><strong>3) Aboout my english:</strong><br /><br />I learned English at school for about 3 years, I am aware that it is not enough. but I think I can express my message to you and you can understand. <br />but I want to clarify that the English is way too important , and I should learn too ...<br /><br /><strong>4) My cs2d skills:</strong><br /><br />Okay... I played this beatifull game for 7 years approximateely (I started playing in 2007) . But there were a few times he had stopped playing (weeks). *EDIT* in Mix &amp; Standard/Pub servers I consider myself a 7.5.<br /><br />Within the map editing I&#039;m good, but not both functions, I need to learn, I admit haha.<br /><br />and scripting have good coworkers, and I think I need to learn about this, but I have my knowledge.<br />in what I relied on scripting security it is at the moment .. (of server, of course)<br /><br />and of course, I can edit scripts.<br /><br />AND... BUT I NEVER REFUSE TO LEARN :)<br /><br /><strong>5) Why should I accept?</strong><br /><br />First thing&#039;s first, I think I have the time to play and care (if I can get the mod) the server.<br /><br />and also seen many cheaters in server, so I like to take pictures or report them, and so make further progress this beautiful server ...<br /><br />also show they earn my trust to do a good moderator ..<br /><br /><strong>6) My personal opinion about this server and community:</strong><br /><br />I think this server also fun, It is a server that shows the union of friends, fond memories, laughter, and respect and agree to the rules.<br /><br />so it takes to make this great game even more fun and enjoyable.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />if I can not get my moderator, anyway I would be grateful that people like you are reading my message. greetings to all.

				Thanks for your application, neo. It was a little hard to understand everything due to some english issues, but it&#039;s still okay to me. You&#039;re atleast able to communicate, which should be enough. On the other hand i would rather suggest to test your moderation experience by giving you jmod first,&nbsp; since i dont really know you.<br />Be patient and i might change my vote after reading other responds, good luck anyway.

				thanks for your comments (negative, neutral and positive) ... <br /><br />first about the mod... for me it is no problem start with jmod (at all).<br /><br />Second... Sorry if I misunderstood english... I feel I need to learn more (which is way too important)<br />but as he says xoot, I hope you can understand .&nbsp; :-[<br /><br />within the server and I have been using my Nicks (Neo - NeoWeY) and if you have not seen me, recently, and he has been playing at night in the server...<br /><br />by the time the server I&#039;m vip user... (maybe my reports has reached them) (of cheaters/hackers within the server) I hope you have been well. <br /><br />and if I do not forget anything else...<br /><br />thanks for comment, thank you for your opinions (both negative and positive)<br />I have in mind their opinions I will help too.<br /><br />about patience you can count on me...<br /><br />Thanks and greetings again ...&nbsp; :) (
