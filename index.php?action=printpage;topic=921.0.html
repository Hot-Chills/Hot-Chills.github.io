				Hey there my beloved community,<br /><br />I know this is a big step but i would like to suggest myself as an admin of our server. Most of the administrative users arent really active, so i would especially like to hear the opinions about the promotion of the existing adminteam and of course happy, too. <br />For everyone who dont know me well at this moment :<br />http://hotchills.org/index.php/topic,876.0.html

				Admins are people that have been SMods for a very long time. And you&#039;ve only been a SMod for about 2 months. Saying we&#039;re not active? Some of us, yes. But if you don&#039;t see us in the server, that doesn&#039;t mean we don&#039;t do anything. Do you see us not accepting/rejecting applications? Not checking the forums maybe? We do that, some of us at least. So that&#039;s that. Anyway, you didn&#039;t even state a proper reason why do you want to be an admin. <strong>Do you lack powers?</strong> Or do you think that we should always be online on the server? That&#039;s partially a moderator&#039;s job. SMods can permanent ban, other ones can use the &quot;Identify&quot; command to give us IPs of the hackers so that us, admins, could ban them. Anyway, sure, we should be online on the server. But we have a tons of mods either, a lot of them just aren&#039;t active for some reason. So please, express your opinion. I&#039;m giving this a no.

				This is what i basically said - most of you arent active.<br />Well, you&#039;re right about the statement that i didnt gave a proper reason why i would like to be an admin of hotchills. Yea i did a mistake, i didnt meant to be admin of he server only i would basically like to be a main administrator to help you guys with the managing stuff. So sorry for the undetailed information. Im aware that managing things like applications/adding userranks etc. isnt always fun, but as we all noticed few things just takes a little longer, thats why i thought it would be a good idea to have a additional person to do these things so we can shorten the progresses a little.

				I&#039;m not able to vote because I&#039;m not a moderator or attempting to be a moderator. Because I have to upgrade my level as a S-Mod before these ranks. But if I had a chance to vote, my opinion will be positive for sure. <br />Because I see you almost everytime I join the server. You are very active and have experience with the moderating as well! Good luck my friend!

				Ofc i can wait, just thought it would be the right time to show that im interested in improving the administration (which isnt bad tbh, but kinda slow currently) thanks for the honest opinions.

				XoOt, i am glad to know that you want to help us in admin&#039;s stuff. But its not easy for us to recruit another admin. Every admin has to agree for this. (even if all 3 admins are willing to accept someone as admin and the 4th one doesn&#039;t want that to happen then we will simply not consider him as a new admin)<br />I know you very well and&nbsp; you&#039;re good enough for this job. But we don&#039;t need new admins as of now. Maybe in future, if we need one then we would surely consider you in the list. Please, don&#039;t consider my opinion in a negative way. If we talk about me, i started my journey here as a jmod. It wasn&#039;t easy for me to become admin.<br />At that time, there were only 2 admins which were enough to manage everything. (Turkey is one of them)<br />Now we&#039;re almost 4 admins which are more than enough. I know you understand this very well and i can say that you&#039;re one of the best SMODS here. Even if i wish to make you admin, nothing can be done until other agree too.<br />So, i can only suggest you to wait. :)

				Destro is really inactive. In my opinion, people who have a chance to become admins in future are Elfing and XoOT. We&#039;re fulfilled with admins now. So, apply for a promotion is rejected. And, as i know, it&#039;s not possible to apply for admin rank. Admins will choose a new adm themselves. But XoOT is really active and i&#039;m glad because of that ;)

				Dont worry im not going to take something wrong. Im fine about your decisions and thanks for clarifying some stuff related to it.&nbsp; Oh and of course you should firstly pick elfing when the time has come, he deserves it way more than i do.

				I appreciate your kind words, I really do but I don&#039;t think I deserve an admin status after being inactive for about a year.<br />If we were lacking admins, XoOt would be the perfect guy to choose. But, like Electron said, we don&#039;t.
