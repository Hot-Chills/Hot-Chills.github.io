				i have got banned from HC Fun server by bounty hunter for just saying (Barca &lt;3) after killing an enemy .. to be honest he warned me not do that&nbsp; but i don&#039;t think there is any thing wrong in that except not obeying the mod order .. he says its a spam where its away of wining for me .. like when some 1 score a goal in foot ball then he celebrates by doing weird things. <br />i am an old player of cs2d and Hc Fun server and i have seen alot of players leaving for stupid reasons like abuse and also other reasons<br /><br />my nick is Barca <br />usgn Sala7y<br />Usgn 23433 <br />rank is 8 in HC Fun server<br /><br />kindly find me a solution for this .. as i can see that bounty hunter is admin .. i asked him to remove the ban and he said i already removed it many times but he is just playing with me so i hope the owners find me a solution <br /><br />Barca &lt;3

				Well, Barca, perhaps you have been fooled. This log I uploaded is only log I played this day. Perhaps this will explain you something. I don&#039;t said that I&#039;ll unban you. You&#039;re unbaned only for 2 hours. Perhaps some other guy faked me, because I really didn&#039;t said that to you.<br />If there was some other things I don&#039;t knew, explain.

				well i know barca for a long long time , very friendly and very very skillfull player . he is i think for over a year and half on hc fun server and i never saw him doing bad things or something else .<br />But i dont think that bounty hunter would kick or ban you just becuase saying ( BArca &lt;3). it has&nbsp; to be a faker .<br />By the way barca you asked me to unban you on the server. i looked up for you twice , your usgn number was not on the usgn ban list so there has to be something wrong

				This is an outrage. Players cannot be banned for just saying one thing over and over again. And muting for 6 hours? That&#039;s just too much. BH, that&#039;s <strong>minor</strong> abusing right there. However, I have one thing to say to Barca too. Barca, if any staff member says to stop doing a thing like spamming, you must not do it then. Believe me, you&#039;re not the innocent one here, Barca. Don&#039;t listen to our staff and there will be more serious punishments. I&#039;m warning you. We make the rules, not you. Being an old player doesn&#039;t count for much.

				Better check logs. I banned him for 2 hours (yes, i did!) for: 1. Spamming (rr will prove you. He asked me himself to punish barca).<br />2. Running from enemies. (camping. Check logs!)<br />3. Totally unhaving any respect for staff member.

				Naber every body .. hope u all doing fine .. <br /><br />i said earlier that my only mistake is that i didn&#039;t obey the mod order even if i think that his order is totally not right .. i am guilty in that ..<br /><br />Mr turkey i am a person playing this to have fun with frnds .. sometimes we like to make challenge when we fight each other in the server .. one way is to celebrate when some 1 beat the other coz this make the game more exiting for us .. other else the server will be some thing routine for us and we get bored .. i want u to understand that when i am celebrating then this is a way for having fun with friends and not to harm any 1 or to spam .. all what u have said is clear for me except 1 thing .. can i celebrate saying the (Barca &lt;3) or its a spam .. hopefully u don&#039;t count it as spam ..<br /><br />btw it hurts me seeing that i get all this punishment for only saying (barca &lt;3) when i see hackers, auto aim and different kind of hacking playing without getting punished .. <br /><br />Peace all <br /><br />Barca &lt;3

				@Barca<br />Saying &quot;Barca &lt;3&quot; is not spamming. But saying it many times, after many warnings is spamming. You was saying these words about twice in 20 seconds. That lasted about 10 minutes. I don&#039;t say I was patient, too. That&#039;s my fault. I agree I was too hot, too. Sorry for it. I shouldn&#039;t ban you before muting you. I hope to be friends with you.
