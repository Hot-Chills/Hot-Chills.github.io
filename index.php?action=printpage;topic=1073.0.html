				Greetings!<br /><br /><br />I would like to suggest to remove some chosen rounds where the winning team is only this one because they click firstly or finally all are dead. I dislike this rounds because it has not really much to do how good you are or which tactic you are going to use.<br /><br />This would for example include the rounds where you have infinite air strikes on your hand and the players get spawned into one part which isn&#039;t <em>in</em> the map and the area is filled with baricades.<br />Also the rounds where you spawn with a chainsaw in this part of the map, and again barricades around you is similar to the other one. There are some others which fit in this style of lucky fight..<br /><br />What do you think about it? Did you get my point of view?<br /><br /><br />cheers

				Yea, right. Something I really don&#039;t like is that round of infinity airstrikes without barricades and no method to escape from them...And other round with chaisanaw and the fight camp just has like 3 squares. Really? I don&#039;t like this idea.<br /><br /><br />I agree with piWi.

				I actually like these rounds, have nothing against it. Just hate round where everybody spawns in small box with gas grenades. There are a few similar rounds.
