				Hello everyone, from my USGN ID, you may know who I&#039;am, my past on this community has been bad and I have acted childish, yes I&#039;am Jepo and I know on the past I have been really childish and I have been that stupid. I regret leaving this amazing and wonderful community and I really wanna get back into it, This is why I&#039;am re - applying for Jr.Mod / Trial.Mod rank and have fun moderating the server again.<br /><br /><br />1) USGN ID: As mentioned on my profile, 137411 - Inflexion<br /><br />2) In-game name: I mostly change my ingame name but here is a common one - Inflexion<br /><br />3) How active you can/will be?: Well, most people (not insulting anyone) can be nolifers, and me I can&#039;t, I have studies, school and stuff, I don&#039;t know how much I would be active, it can be different everytime so yes, but I&#039;m going to try my best to be active as much as possible!<br /><br />4) Have you had any prior experience as a moderator? I&#039;ve had bunch load experiences as moderator in CS2D, and I do not remember the server names sorry, I just don&#039;t remember, really sorry.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Moderating a roleplay server: I once was Mod in a roleplay server, the server used to get about 16 players daily (average) and the owner was really a chill guy, and the server was a bit full of cheaters, I used to ban these cheaters at daily activity and I was one of the most active staff members, I was appreciated by the Owner and even other staff (Admins, Sr.Mods), players also used to thank me everytime I punish sort of a person using unfair advantage to exploit the game.<br />- Owning an RPG server: I used to own an RPG server, and not Tibia of course, people used to enjoy that server, I was the only person owning and administrating, I had like 2 Moderators, one Manager and about 3-4 Trial Moderators, the server had really good experience and it was running perfectly, we had over 11-21 players a day and&nbsp; everyone was enjoying the server<br />- Old Moderating in HC: If you don&#039;t remember, I was a moderator in Hot Chills like a year ago, I was appreciated a few people, and to be honest I had a few bad moments, but still, the server was really great and I enjoyed moderating in it, and I loved playing with other people.<br /><br />5) Why exactly do you want to be a Mod/SMod?: I wanna be a Mod, maybe a SrMod (nosure) because daily cheaters come into the server and start cheating and exploiting glitches and alot stuff, on my past experience, I have noticed that people do spam alot, flood alot and do alot of bad things that shouldn&#039;t be done in a Teens - Adults game, that&#039;s why I wanna protect the server from these nasty cheaters and reward the good.<br /><br />6) Something about yourself we should/could know: When I used to be a moderator in HC, I used to be childish, retarded (sorry for the word) and stupid, but now I can be really mature and help as much as possible, - I can manage server applications if wanted, and I can make a guide for staff members. <br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />That&#039;s it, thank you for reading and hope you enjoyed!<br />

				Please don&#039;t be dumb, I don&#039;t crash servers. <br />It&#039;s like 9 months I didn&#039;t touch the CS2D logo how can you confirm that,<br />send me proof of me crashing servers..

				Never said when you crashed it, I don&#039;t follow you or anything but remember Dartex? The story?<br />Lil crasher you think I need proof? I&#039;m not even a VIP here so I don&#039;t care even if you&#039;re the new admin, posted my opinion based off recent behaviours of yours...<br />Also Dartex might still have the Skype logs of you clearly telling us you are the one who crashed his server (remember MIGHT) so don&#039;t be so happy fancy because you&#039;ve been hidden for a few months.<br /><br />So pretty sure you crashed Dartex&#039;s server probably also some doghouse servers and the rest is up to you to decide.<br /><br />Admins, be aware on your decision, it might be your last... (jk no worries everyone love crashers as moderators! :D)<br /><br />A man&#039;s past might be in the past, but it&#039;s not gone.

				1. I (maybe) respect your opinion, but, tell me when did I &quot;crash&quot; those &quot;servers&quot;.<br />2 . I don&#039;t even know what&#039;s Dartex server<br />3 . It wasn&#039;t me but it was another guy and it was as a joke when I said I crashed those Doghouse servers, I don&#039;t even care about CS2D servers anymore, I&#039;am just here to help and if I&#039;am not accepted, I won&#039;t really be raging out.<br />If they want help, they&#039;ll accept me, I don&#039;t staff hunt like most people do

				Sorry for being rude, but really, you literally decide some negative decisions without even reading the thread for 1 minute<br /><br />For example Leum (not hating on him) He did like 6 lines of a staff application, you instantly accept him, at least take time and ask him questions, not just go directly and accept, (I&#039;m not bashing out on him)
