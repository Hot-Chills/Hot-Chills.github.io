				Hello! I&#039;m Griff<br />Been playing HC//Fun for a long time. Never had any complaints and this is my favorite server.However today a moderator awarded me mute without giving and rational explanation (Well the Reason stated was : Shutup Nabbie) give by .::dyn::Evergree (or similar name since he had many symbols) (USGN ID 153457). When I protested against the mute , I was muted for a second time , this time for 7 minutes &amp; the reason given was &quot;that he was tired with me&quot;. He was taunting me as well (eg. by using xD after the mute). He also started to kick me out of the server with reasons beyond common sense. In response&#039;I protested by dropping my gun infront of him and changing name (like Griff against Bullies etc). He muted me for a third time for 10 minutes giving the reason &quot;Shutup Nabbie&quot; and kicked me again and again. He was not alone; Mew ( who has requested to become a jMoD here ) also said him to mute me without finding the reason.<br /><br />After 1.5 hrs&nbsp; he left the server,only to return. I asked him why he muted me&#039;to which he replied that he was &quot;tired of me&quot;.<br /><br />See the attached screenshots;There is time in lower right hand corner (as per IST).<br />Please help! I dont want to be bullied again.<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; 1&nbsp; Forgot to tell that joined the forums to report him.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; See stats : 1462&nbsp; &nbsp;Griff&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141587&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1167&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2828&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2833&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4494&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 d 23 h (page 15)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 http://hotchills.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1102 Yup thats him (Mast#)

				Mast, your explanation doesnt seem that reliable and his given screenshots and other informations about the situation are clearly showing that you&#039;ve done something wrong and if you&#039;re sure that he spammed and that was the reason because you&#039;ve muted him, than you need to show the logs, otherwise it isn&#039;t possible to trust your sentences.<br />And it seems to be the truth that you&#039;ve kicked him with this reason, that isn&#039;t the behaviour which a Moderator should show and what&#039;s the sense of the space where you can add a reason when you kick somebody.<br />Really weird..<br /><br />Cheers

				I hate when people have brawls on other servers, and then our server/moderators is/are involved in that bullshit, since someone has more power. Taking revenge by using powers is not acceptable, you both need to solve your problems with words.<br />As piwi said, it would be nice to see the logs, because i&#039;m not sure who am i to blame.<br />@Mast, you can mute people as long as it is considered as a true spam/flaming/insult etc.<br />While kicking people, you need to give appropriate reasons, like: &quot;Please stop spamming/We don&#039;t appreciate insults/Don&#039;t make us ban you&quot;, but writing something offensive is not really helpful :/<br />

				Although I do not like Griff (personal reasons) i must say that what you have done is not worthy of a responsible moderator, i didn&#039;t say this in your apply mast but in my opinion most of the times you are immature, if you want to keep your position on this community you must change your behavior and know when it&#039;s the time to play, and when it&#039;s the time to be serious.<br /><br /><br />That being said I recommend you to apologize to Griff and explain him the reason why he was muted.<br /><br /><br />Regards

				Always remember that you must not let personal skirmishes conflict with your moderation on another server with someone. Because that other server has a different set of rules and as long as the player isn&#039;t breaking the rules on that server, it would be considered abuse to take action for the rules he broke for the other server.<br /><br />The purpose of the reason parameter in commands is partially for the admins as well. It has to be clear and direct so administrators can understand what was going on much more easily. Think of it has a note to the admins.<br /><br />Also remember that whatever the consequences from this, only learn from it. Don&#039;t consider it humorous. You now know something that you did wrong, your next move would be improving on it. Your actions here are also judged by the admins so be careful.<br />And lastly, never lose your cool.

				That&#039;s not the case, even I was doing things wrong when I started out as a Jmod here. Dont think of the demotion as a punishment. Think of it as off time given for you to improve yourself, I&#039;d like to see an improved you back on the moderation team. ;)
