				If you were mature, you would ignore him. There is point to feed troll. The more you talk to him the more he flame.

				i do not even said a word to him, BUT he started saying on me gay. I ignored him, but at least i become anger, after about 10 horrible words like shit, fuck, dick, suck my dick and others. Then i said i&#039;ll report u, because i&#039;m vip, so then he said: &quot;Ok, my dick sucker, try to fuck off&quot;&nbsp; :o

When they connect, he stops. He&#039;s not insulting me anymore because he&#039;s afraid of me. A few times per day I connect without my USGN login and with name &quot;Player&quot;. About 3 days ago I caught him online and I noticed, that he was cursing very much. That&#039; all what I wanted to say.<br /><br />P.S. I think he checks logged in players with voting function. If he cannot vote then it means they&#039;re mods/admins.
