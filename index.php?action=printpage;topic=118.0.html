				I can just repeat what Bonzo already wrote. The idea itself is nice, but I&#039;m afraid these short rounds will end up in an acoustic apocalypse.

				Don&#039;t really think this is a good idea for players who like to play in Hc //Fun and hear the sound of the guns,weapons,etc. Because a lot of Players/users in the server are like really good and well it would spam the sound and stuff witch is really annoying so I vote No unless you can add some option in the menu that would disable the kill streak sounds for the user like in f2 or something but that probably would be to hard.

				well since its a Fun server, it would be a good idea but yes spam is a problem so start it at mabye 5 kpd?<br />something high so there&#039;s not much spam&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />edit: just read posts and wanted to say agree with Tits :P

				H@ppy, please don&#039;t do this, I am not even mentioning how unnecessary it is.The big problems are the annoyance (when 20+ people die in seconds) and the LAAAAGGG, server is laggy enough<br />A big no from me.

				Here are my opinions;<br />1- it should be for VIPs<br />2- VIPs will have the option to turn it on or off<br /><br />3- My other opinion is that it should be left out, because isn&#039;t the simpler the server is, the better?
