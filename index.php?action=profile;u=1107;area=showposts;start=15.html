					Well for a long time no new interesting post has come up so I came up with my own Question which I think will be pretty interesting<br /><br /><strong>How Did you come to know about cs2d <img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" /></strong><br /><br /><br />My story:-<br />Actually few of you may know about <a href="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK</a> which is essentialy a tool to make your camera scriptable (Guess what the scripting language is!!).So here I was looking for lua games which I thought might be possible to run on my Canon camera. Since cs2d also used lua, I ended up downloading and playing it, first of the servers being DraftCity,Jail and Hide and Seek.Slowly I started playing the multiMode genre and thus HC//Fun.

					Well this is not my decision to make, but I&#039;ll tell you people an incident few days ago....<br />I was playing by the name Player (Yeah the Generic &quot;Player&quot;) on one of the Deathrun server. I saw him playing but first ignored him,but the curiosity got the better of me and so I asked him about the &quot;incident&quot; indirectly and well Guess what I got in reply? He said that he got demoted due to muting a spammer!. And here I was thinking like a fool that you have realised what you have done.<br />Really? Even after a month I&#039;m a spammer?? That really hurt.<br /><br />I revealed my identity. He said nice then moved on. I&#039;ll provide the logs if you want.<br /><br />He in my last post said that I wanna destroy him.But this is not for &quot;revenge&quot;,to &quot;destroy&quot; him or nothing, all I wanted (and still want) was an explanation which made sense to me or an assurance that this will not happen again and maybe an apology (A sorry many times suffices in these minor scuffles).<br /><br /><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">I just don&#039;t see any change and thus no reason for promotion</span>.That&#039;s my opinion.(Highlighted because this seems to be a long post).<br /><br />I reiterate that its not my decision to make, it is HC//Fun&#039;s (Admins and Mods unanimously). I guess since you people already had him as a JMod you might find it easier to recruit him tham others but I hope that you people take my opinion into consideration as well.

Here you go!<br /><br />Quote from: Griff on Yesterday at 13:55:59<br />Hey How did the name &quot;Hotchills&quot; come from???<br /><br />Hi. It is just something I came up with. I had used the letters &quot;HC&quot; for my servers for a while. When I wanted to set up a website with its own domain, I had to make up something that sounded cool and could represent the acronym HC. I chose &quot;Hot Chills&quot; since it&#039;s a contradiction. People talk about cold chills and hot flashes but never the opposite.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2.

Anyone having problems staying away from this game for too long??</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Actually it&#039;s a trick question (as asked in exams). What I meant to say that has anyone managed to not play this game for a long stretch (i.e. 3 months) cuz I delete the game and after a few days reinstall it!!!.Even when exams hover on my head . (Oh no I mentioned exams twice! Something Bad gonna happen now!)

If I don&#039;t solve this I&#039;ll recive my punish. So, Griffo, do you wanna forget this,<br />and start again as friends in CS2D? -I<br />don&#039;t wanna get my demote.

We should resolve this by dialogue. OR<br />2. We should resolve this so that you don&#039;t get demoted.<br />2.

Everyone knows SPAM is when someone intentionally posts unrelated and off-topic messages which ironically you gave me as reasons for mute/kick. Also why wasn&#039;t I told about spam if you believe it so much?<br />I&#039;m asking you one last time, why was I INITIALLY MUTED?

					Hello! I&#039;m Griff<br />Been playing HC//Fun for a long time. Never had any complaints and this is my favorite server.However today a moderator awarded me mute without giving and rational explanation (Well the Reason stated was : Shutup Nabbie) give by .::dyn::Evergree (or similar name since he had many symbols) (USGN ID 153457). When I protested against the mute , I was muted for a second time , this time for 7 minutes &amp; the reason given was &quot;that he was tired with me&quot;. He was taunting me as well (eg. by using xD after the mute). He also started to kick me out of the server with reasons beyond common sense. In response&#039;I protested by dropping my gun infront of him and changing name (like Griff against Bullies etc). He muted me for a third time for 10 minutes giving the reason &quot;Shutup Nabbie&quot; and kicked me again and again. He was not alone; Mew ( who has requested to become a jMoD here ) also said him to mute me without finding the reason.<br /><br />After 1.5 hrs&nbsp; he left the server,only to return. I asked him why he muted me&#039;to which he replied that he was &quot;tired of me&quot;.<br /><br />See the attached screenshots;There is time in lower right hand corner (as per IST).<br />Please help! I dont want to be bullied again.<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; 1&nbsp; Forgot to tell that joined the forums to report him.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2&nbsp; See stats : 1462&nbsp; &nbsp;Griff&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141587&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1167&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2828&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2833&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4494&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 d 23 h (page 15)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 <a href="index.php%3Faction=profile%3Bu=1102.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://hotchills.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1102</a> Yup thats him (Mast#)
