				hey people, max here. So, cs2d activity gets down and down and down every single day.<br />I wanted to make a thread like this to know what server you like me to run, I&#039;m not trying actually to advertise or anything else, I mean just want to know what server most people and you guys would like to play on or something.<br />If this topic leads to flame, I&#039;m just gonna close it because i just need opinions.<br /><br /><br /><em><strong>The server will run 24/7.</strong></em><br />Don&#039;t forget to mention the lua you&#039;d like with the gamemode.<br /><br />In comments you&#039;ll have to comment below, what gamemode you selected on the poll + what lua you want with it (link)<br />

				Good old HT. It&#039;s what got me into this game. If you would create a good HT server with a good script I&#039;m certain I would play there.

				Happy Town, it think a Server with this won&#039;t succed.<br />Zombie, idk about this because i don&#039;t like to play it.<br />Construction, it is hard to get player for this.<br />Doghouse, i guess you won&#039;t be able to start a server with this. The unique of Fws Doghouse is that they have this script, without this it wont work.<br />Jail, that&#039;s my favourite. But you have to get active players because already Fws have running a server with this... At all, i upload a Jail Map, Iowa Penitentiary on us.de. Perhaps you like it. I guess it isn&#039;t ready for a server. But would be happy about more feedback.<br />...

				actually, there&#039;s an equality.<br />Any gamemode reaches 5 votes will get&nbsp; added.<br /><br />+ By the way, I forget to mention the server will be down starting from today due to some glitches. I&#039;ll ask ken about that.
