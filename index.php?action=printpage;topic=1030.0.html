				This is a pretty good idea.<br />Although, i think that most of the people playing on the server are not mature or skilled enough to get Moderator powers. <br />I just don&#039;t want the forum to be flooded with applications from players that aren&#039;t very experienced in such things, thus resulting rejections..<br />I would just have a conversation with people that i might trust.&nbsp; :o

				I think the chat ad in white &quot;hotchills.org&quot; every 5 or 10 minutes is enough. Everyone can tap F1 for more details.

But honestly who reads F1 if he isn&#039;t searching for such an information? Most of the player do not. This Message wouldn&#039;t need much effort so I would change the current message to something like this:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: times new roman;" class="bbc_font">You want to become a Moderator? Visit hotchills.org!</span><br /><br />...and this message every third round start.<br /><br />@Hygorgh, well. the point is that this is the truth but under this amount of players also some mature players who could get a chance, and this argument you could add nearly on every idea which has to do with the effort to visit a forum or any other task.<br /><br />Cheers

				Na, the rank shouldn&#039;t be a thing for which we should looking for, it&#039;s more the activity.<br /><br />@CrazyF.M., yeah, every third round could be to much, but 10 minutes are for me to less, I would suggest something like 6 minutes.<br /><br />@Hygorgh, well, even there are so many guys who would be a good choice, so I think it isn&#039;t such a bad idea to add this function.

I wouldn&#039;t recommend that. Anyway, i appreciate your concern. This time, i am not gonna accept any application that easily. We need active, experienced and nice people in our team. I don&#039;t want anyone who just apply for rank, plays for 1-2 weeks and leaves without informing.
