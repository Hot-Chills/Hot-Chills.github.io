				As I&#039;ve already heard two different stories of what happened I&#039;m not going to take sides in this argument.<br />Instead we will wait until happy Camper posts logs of what happened here. Then we will see who is right and who is wrong. Meanwhile you should both stop acting childish and get along on the server. Both of you can ignore each-other for the time being.

				Calm down..<br />What you&#039;re doing right now does nothing to help you in this situation. You are just showing yourself as the one to blame.<br />I wasn&#039;t there so I can&#039;t tell who is right and who is not. We are going to wait, unless either of you wants to post your own logs of what happened.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />After reading through the logs I can say I&#039;m very disappointed in both of you.<br />Maciek has gotten a temporary forum ban lasting 2 days.<br />Alex, I&#039;m not very amused by what you said there either. I&#039;ll be keeping an eye on you from now on.

				I believe Alex but Bonzo is right. We have to look at logs.
