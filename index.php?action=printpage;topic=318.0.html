				I dont like when players appears in some place with weapns, and i tried to quick change weapn and it rechange it back. For example, when we get machets and shields, i change weapon to matchete as fast as it possible and it rechange me to shield.. Its like system is slower than my weapon changing.. Have had same prob again with another weapon similar to ak, i changed for it then to knife and i noticed no more weapons so wanted change for gun again but it autoaticly changed it so when i pressed Q it came back to knife. It lasts less than 1 sec but its enough to get killed cus of disorganization. Is it server or whole cs2d setting ?

				It&#039;s the script. Without it, it could sometimes look like you were using one weapon, but the server thought you were using another one. So you might think you were blasting your AK-47, while, according to the server, you were cutting with your knife in thin air. The workaround I made was to change the weapon half a second or so after you spawn. I am not sure how to solve this in a better way, unfortunately.
