				I just killed one of your moderators at the beginning of the match, and he spawned himself to continue playing. My thought is: if a moderator can do that, can i do that too, so i can avoid waiting a long time until the end of the match like ordinary people in the server? Also, is it fair if the opposite team wins because you respawn himself again?

				The only thing the logs will prove is that it&#039;s impossible for moderators to respawn themselves via commands (with currently used scripts)... <br /><br />Check the second line &quot;Player&quot;... you killed weed, not me.

				Not even senior moderators can spawn players(or themselves) on the server&#039;s admin script. It&#039;s not on your logs as well so what was experienced here was most likely psychological. It seems you were so fixated upon killing xoot that your brain perceived a false-positive (it was someone else). Happens. ._.

				Dude,it&#039;s impossible for anyone to spawn again in the same round. Forget about moderators, even admins can&#039;t do that.

				If you use the spawnhook in your scripts or got rcon it&#039;s possible to spawn as often as you want, but both of them is impossible in my situation as the script on Server got no spawnhook related command nor i got the rcon password.

				Well,we don&#039;t need a rcon. But I guess I have a !rcon command in the commands list. Never used it before.

				The only thing i can see from the logs is that i killed 3 people in 9seconds and two of them rq after death :D no honestly, first you should check the possibilities before reporting someone, alternatecheck.
