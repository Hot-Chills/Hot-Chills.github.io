				I would like to ask you Happy about one thing. Is there possiblity to give me special Santa Claus outfit? I changed my nick in game to Santa Claus, I dressed Santa Hat but i would like to get full Santa suit :D From time to time i use ¦ to write msg without my nick name in which i tells Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!<br />I would like to be HC Santa ;D Its just my idea to add something funny on server. Its ofc only question, just needed to try. <br />You can ask, why me? Ofc you can chose someone other but i will say, that i am good one for this becuase:<br />At 1st i play this server really long, i have never done anything to destroy community or server, 2nd point is that most of players knows me here becuase i am 1st (and ofc cus of time spent on server) and 3rd, last one point is that i am active member of HC // Fun COMMUNITY on this forum.<br />I look forward to your quick reply<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Santa Claus :)<br /><br />@edit<br />Or even better! I was singing christmas song and i though up you could add some Voice like HO HO HO! (you know, like go go go which u turn on by command) and give permision, for player who you could give what i said up^.

				This is ridiculous.<br /><br />Which is why I support this idea!<br /><br />It would help break the monotony routine and cheer up the server. Coupled with the Christmas-themed map it really would look interesting.<br /><br />As for Maciek being Santa, that&#039;s a decent idea too. He&#039;s very active on the server, and if he could manage being nice (Santas don&#039;t insult anybody, not even the naughty kids) then he&#039;d be perfect. Not to mention he&#039;s skilled so the Santa would be a bringer of joy and somebody not a complete derp.<br /><br />Make it happen, Happy.

				I would try to be calm. I still thinks about details. Also could be added instead of &gt;Vip&lt;, &gt;Saint&lt; or something like that. I dont know how hard it is to be done, but could also be something like Presents instead of snowballs. I didnt expect support from you Bonzo or rest stuff, cus i know that i am not such a cool guy. I have my own problems, sometimes (like last time) i am gettin furious but noone is perfect. I want to apologise Light (he aint availible as i read, but maybe he will visit forum). So i am sorry Light, didnt want to be mean to you.

				Yeah, that&#039;s nice idea. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s possible, maciek may wear santa skin, visible for all, if HC will accept this idea (http://unrealsoftware.de/files_show.php?file=9619 - I recently remembered, that i made santa skin some years ago, lol). And if HC will accept N&#039;s idea, other christmas skins may be taken here: http://unrealsoftware.de/files_show.php?file=4539 (not advertisement&nbsp; ;D).

				Thanks. Can you connect to HC // Fun using IP and port? I think the problem is just that the server is missing from the U.S.G.N. list. I saw a post about that on the Fws forum. DC has been notified.

				Yeah. I can join to the server without any problems by typing in console connect 151.80.45.124:36963. My friend VaiN had same problem so maybe this topic (http://unrealsoftware.de/forum_posts.php?post=212133) will help you.

				Firstly, this is a bigger Problem. It includes more Servers and if you contact Nighthawk, he was already speaking with DC, i guess.<br />And secondly, the &quot;new&quot; de_dust chrismasmap is too bright. You have problems to take a fast look on your hp, portals guns can watched more difficult and more. In my opinion, it makes no advantages. The tiles are still too bright in my opinion.<br /><br />Here some examples:<br />HP:<br />(http://www.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/unbenanntm7bnsi2903.png) (http://www.fotos-hochladen.net)<br /><br />Mines:<br />(http://www.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/unbenannt2418s9hgaju.png) (http://www.fotos-hochladen.net)<br /><br />Portals:<br />(http://www.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/unbenannt3410ea6gmlz.png) (http://www.fotos-hochladen.net)<br /><br />Edit: Well, on the screenshots, you don&#039;t see much stuff but it is like i explained. Also the background of the map is still white.
