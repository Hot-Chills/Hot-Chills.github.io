				Hey,<br /><br />The main reason i&#039;m applying for this is to finally ban cheaters permamently.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really know what to say. I&#039;m quite sure I&#039;m one of the most active players on the server since I started playing.<br /><br />In the two weeks I have been a mod I banned quite a few cheaters. I record evidence before banning the cheaters and whenever I have some free energy I upload them to this youtube channel:<br />https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj2FQcK0jplScRnOKx7Dqiw/<br /><br />With that in mind I think it isn&#039;t very risky giving me permban since I can back up all of my decisions. I&#039;m ready to be demoted whenever I&#039;m found abusing permban. In case I ban someone innocent, I will report that immidietly of course.

				2 weeks are definitely not enough. Of course, your video records are good, but I don&#039;t think we know you enough and you can&#039;t ensure us that you won&#039;t leave this community after 1 month.

				I play 2-4 hours regularly every day. I don&#039;t play undercover and I say hi to every mod I see. The fact that sometimes days pass without seeing a single moderator (let alone admins) makes me think its not my fault that you don&#039;t know me. On the other hand I made quite a few friend with the server regulars, those that are actually active on the server. This might also be the reason you should consider letting me ban cheaters for good.<br /><br />And well about leaving. Its always a possibility and I make no promises. Clearly I will leave when I get bored with the game and then I might come back later. <br /><br />Edit: Bounty, I sent you a long message with many points, not long ago. You did not read it, at least not all of it.<br />If you don&#039;t bother reading one&#039;s messages, how do you expect to get to know him?<br /><br />Please forgive me for sounding disrespectful, its not my intention. I just don&#039;t respond well to false logic.

				Do not know him, however he seems mature and probably won&#039;t make erroneous decisions. If he&#039;s inactive the server will automatically demote him so no issues there. However you applied too quickly, should&#039;ve waited enough to get other mods to know him for a gain in trust.<br /><br /><del>Good luck.</del><br /><br />Edit: Looks like he got accepted while I was writing!<br />Congratulations. ;)

				Congrats.<br /><br />He somehow deserved it even if he is new to this site but areos is freaking active and acts like a real moderator everytime i see him around the server so ye i think iit&#039;s just right to promote him.

				This is going to be a long message Bounty, I know you don&#039;t like to read that much, thats why you failed to understand my similarly long PM, but please if you pick a fight with me, expect replies of this quality from me.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Haha that was funny. You are a funny guy.<br /><br />I know it might get old soon now, but please remember that im not new to moderating. I will not go into comparing the length of our - as you put it - &quot;career&quot; as a moderator, because that would make you look even younger than you are.<br /><br />You are childish. I called you out the way you deserved it for ignoring my message and now you feel the need to try to put me down.<br />You - quote - &quot;marked&quot; how many cheater you banned, like there is supposed to be a leaderboard for that to show how very professional you are. This number you were very proud of was 80. Applauds to you sir, I&#039;m probably halfway through it in only 3 weeks. <br /><br />Now, I&#039;m amateur according to you. I usually enjoy being insulted, that means I stood up for something but I will not take that from you. But for the sake of your satisfaction, alright. <br /><br />May I ask what makes you say that?<br /><br />That failed attempt to test my patience with you? When you went incognito and started spamming &quot;fuk u&quot; senselessly from the very same IP adress you disconnected literally few seconds before? I actually expected that from you. I honestly don&#039;t know what your agenda was there. If you thought you will catch me abusing by getting under my skin, then clearly we are not on the same level of maturity. If this was your best way to test me, then who is the amateur?<br /><br />Or does the countless times (two to be exact) we met on the server makes you an expert at my moderating skills? Clearly if you played with me more than a few minutes you would know that so far I handled every situation without having to put on my tags or openly state that I&#039;m in charge of keeping peace. Yeah thats right there are only a few regulars who know I&#039;m a mod and only because I told them to message me instead of making drama in the main chat about a cheater.<br />Being undercover was not only requested by fellow moderator but it is common sense too. The fact that you openly implied my rank after &quot;testing me&quot; on the server makes you the amateur from the two of us, again.<br /><br />Bounty, you are free to criticize me any time, but please stop trying to proove you are the more experienced authority, you are not. You were still picking your nose when I started being an admin, you only make yourself look like a fool.<br /><br />As for everyone else, I&#039;m sorry that we have to do this publicly, but I&#039;m done PMing with Bounty, this way at least I have a chance to get a decent reply from him.<br /><br />@N&#039;: sos was !kill&#039;d and warned in PM I just didn&#039;t get that on camera (as I wasn&#039;t recording him before he started blocking obviously). My videos are mainly for the purpose of showing the rulebreak in case someone comes to the forum denying them. I can&#039;t record everything, these videos already take a lot of storage on my computer (very high quality before uploading to YouTube). For cheaters I obviously have proof, for troublemakers I very much rely on server logs.

				Just read this now cause i was fixing my pc (after failure to try to overclock). I&#039;m writing this via phone. What you said about spam and insult, thats my way to test new mods. I&#039;ve done this to rohan, keno, syndicate and some of others, (perhaps oxo, i think). In earlier testings i wasnt changing my ip (brains,brains), mods didnt bother to check and compare my ips. After id test them, id reveal myself and theyd be just confused. You acted harshly. (sorry if you thought I was doing this really to insult you.) I wanted to say sorry for not trusting you but, after that i didnt bothered to do that so could some of admins demote me (to user, id prefer, I&#039;ve got summer job). If you need admins, id like xoot or elfie instead of me. Thanks :) there are many types of peoples in internet. :)<br /><br />EDIT: By the way, I can upload logs and logs when I&#039;ve done this with KeNo or Rohie.
