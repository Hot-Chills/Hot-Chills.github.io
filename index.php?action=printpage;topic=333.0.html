				N&#039; has indeed shaked and muted Shark Boy. But for what reasons ?<br />Maybe either N&#039;, Shark Boy, or Happy Camper could provide us with logs from that incident so the administrators could determine what happened and who&#039;s at fault here.

				So i will also add my complain about lait. Before upgrade he was shit talking about this multi coloured messages. He was all the time talking that one message = spam. For me it look like abuse order to not useing it even once or twice per day cause i didnt use it more then 3 times per day. Also he writes really often &quot;What the fuck&quot; where fuck is offensive word, isnt it ?

				From the looks of it, Shark Boy possibly detonated the mines on purpose?<br />Either that or it was by accident but N&#039; still thought it was deliberate.<br />Still, such a thing can happen to anyone so I don&#039;t think N&#039;&#039;s actions were justified. Possibly a warning since he hasn&#039;t been causing trouble before ?<br />Demoting for 2 shakes and a mute doesn&#039;t sound like a fair punishment to me.

				OMG. Look i killed just 3 enemies but i had like 6 or 7 . He destroyed my mine and placed his mine . What about shark its terrible situation . what about&nbsp; to shark, there is a terrible situation. He constantly offends someone. I always give him a chance after the 2-4 - I give mute for hour. I had my way I would have muddied forever. A feeling that he came to the server that would pounizhat people and socialize. If I do badly behave aggressively, remove me from this position. But I&#039;ll stand my ground against Sharks.still infuriates me that he says that he is a professional. Excuse me, boiling.<br />Thx for attention<br />with love N` :3

				Not he can, but he is. I changed nick name he told that i am hacker. But hes young. I would forget about that. For me N is good player, and he doesnt abuse his powers. I dont know how about his behaviour in this situatnions but i havent got any bad storys connected with his mod powers. Unfortunately i know shark boy. Just forget about this.<br />@EDIT - &gt; Not he can, but he is. I changed nick name he told that i am hacker. But hes young. I would forget about that. -&gt; is about Sharkboy

				Yes Maciek , &quot;fuck&quot; is offensive word but i say &quot;wtf&quot; only when i get attacked by 3 or 4&nbsp; players at once and i get killed. And when you type &quot;OWNED&quot; in color ( OWN is red and ED is blue or the other way around i forgotten ) and what about when some player lags or isn&#039;t playing well because he is new or has some problems with his pc or mouse,keyboard...U say &quot;Vote this nooob of he is laging&quot; or he cant play. And 2 hours ago you said to N to kick some &quot;idiot&quot; of because he couldn&#039;t play or something like that and what about 2 weeks ago when you said &quot;Light kick this nooob he is destroying my mines &quot; i told him to stop he didn&#039;t i told him again nothing i slapped him and he stop or when you&nbsp; were writing &quot;OWNED&quot; and somebody told me to say to you that u stop abusing i told you that and you boardcasted &quot;Who idiot told that i abuse controls&quot; some one answered &quot;What&quot; then maciek said &quot; So its u i will remember u nooob &quot;(i am writing &quot;nooob&quot; with 3 &quot;ooo&quot; because u can see the hole thing proper like it happened ) whats with that maciek and when some one doesn&#039;t listen to you ,you start to non-stop spaming (&quot;Vote this idiot&quot;)!!! Now explain that pls .... Thanks for reading this and pls try to understand what i written and thanks again

				Tons of lies. U writes wtf whole time cus u &quot;get attacked by 3 or 4 players&quot; all the time, so its ur foult u cant play, but you do it constantly (it could be called spam). I used OWNED in colours only if someone make me mad. I just provoke him, and tries to make anger (its always work) IS it ABUSE to write it 2 times per day ? Its not abusing commands cus everybody can do this and F1 Didnt say i cant use it twice per day. I said to N to kick guy who whole time spammin ITS MACIEK ITS MACIEK (it was annying) BECAUSE he ALSO destroyed my mines and putted his own. ( same situation when i asked about it you). Continuing i wrote to this guy (about abusing, what is ridiculus, cus writting owned 2 times per day in coulours aint abusing) that hes nob cus he was just jealous, and he behave like motherfcking squealer.<br /><br />Also i want to add that you are worst mod i have ever seen. 2nd one is semith who was abusing his powers like you. All the time we can hear &quot;wtf&quot; x99 &quot;hi all&quot; (twice if nobody anserw) &quot;bye all&quot; (same situation) and last one most annying - &quot;dont camp&quot; x99 ( i get that if someone blocks him self in tp by moltows, but when he stays in bush or something like that its not CAMPING, ITS HIDDING! ROUNDS LASTS FOR 3 MIN, YOU CANT WAIT TILL HIS STRATEGY WILL WORK ? (ofc if he stays whole round, its something other)) Will add that also annying is &quot;PM- HI MACIEK&quot; also twice till i anserw.

				Yes when i get attacked&nbsp; by 3 or 4 players and u say OWNED every time when u survive a round and i always tell players when the are hiding in palms or hide in smoke ......that they don&#039;t camp and if don&#039;t listen i tell them again &quot; don&#039;t camp guys &quot; or i say &quot; no camping &quot; and some times &quot; everyone read f1 &quot; i say &quot;hi all&quot; because i wana be friendly to all like when everyone of players that join and wana be friendly says &quot;hi all&quot; and when they are going to leave i say &quot;by all&quot; or &quot;BB&quot; and when some other player leaves and say &quot; by &quot; i say to him &quot; by &quot; so tell me on what way i am breaking the rules and that you said that i cant play is because i am getting better&nbsp; like you when u downloaded cs2d and started playing you weren&#039;t good but after some months u gotten better am i right ???? so some guy spamed &quot; Maciek its Maciek &quot; and it was annoying you how the other players fell when u kill them and mock in there faces with OWNED or when u spam &quot; Maciek is king of HC // fun &quot; and other players are trying to be good but u still mock them !!!! In some way that u said &quot; You are the worst mod ever &quot; is an insult isn&#039;t it u tell me . And i say &quot;hi maciek &quot; because i thought that we were friends because that normal friends do. Like when some one see s me and tell&#039;s me &quot;hi&quot; i tell them &quot; hi &quot;to .....

				&quot; i say &quot;hi all&quot; because i wana be friendly to all like when everyone of players that join and wana be friendly says &quot;hi all&quot; and when they are going to leave i say &quot;by all&quot; or &quot;BB&quot; and when some other player leaves and say &quot; by &quot; i say to him &quot; by &quot;&quot; Its called spamming. Telling owned twice per day aint. Also if i tell my opinion that u are worst if hc stuff its insulting ? I just called u worst member. Its fact. And i have never spammed. You should STUDY meanning of word &quot; SPAM&quot; STUDY STUDY. You lack of experiens in game is piecing me off. Just piecing me off. I am going to ingore you.

				I guess I should add that &quot;u are worst member&quot; is not a fact but a judgement. Facts are okay but judgements can offend your opponent so you should watch carefully what you write.<br /><br />Also &quot;Fire in the hole&quot; radio messages can be turned off in the game options.

				This is old post. Anyway, I will say my opinion.<br />1. If player do not see mines and they explode, this is player&#039;s fault, because he need to look around in mines round.<br />2. Shark Boy was not worth 1 day mute. I would mute him only for 5 minutes.<br />He do not insulted/spammed very much. It was only one time. Anyway, it is better to do not curse when you are playing.
