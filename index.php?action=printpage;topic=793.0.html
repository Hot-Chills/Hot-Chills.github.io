				It&#039;s been a while since I played cs2d, I&#039;m glad to see the community is still active and alive!&nbsp; :D<br />You may ask why I left, well there are some reasons, most of them are real life problems which caused me to quit gaming but the main one are the exams.<br />When the exams began... my activity decreased but I was still playing HC from time to time. When I realized that I don&#039;t have time to keep moderating the server, I told Turkey to pin my rank till I come back, but as time passed I lost interest in playing CS2D and I forgot about the community which is my fault.<br />Anyway, I had fun with you guys! Chilla, Turkey I hope we will reunite some day and moderate HC together... as always&nbsp; ;D<br />And Happy Camper, I hope you&#039;re not mad at me for abandoning the Community.<br /><br />That&#039;s all, so... feel free to post your opinions and stuff :3

				Yes Ezio, I was demoted to VIP from Senior Moderator due to my inactivity even though my rank was pinned by Turkey I guess it was unpinned after a while.
