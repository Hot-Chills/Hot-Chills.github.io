				Dear Forum,<br /><br />Today I want to write an application for a Mod in HC Fun because I think I would be an enrichment for your server!<br /><br />Firstly some general information about me. I am 19 years old and playing cs2d since 2011. Honestly I don&#039;t play much at my computer, the only game which I enjoy is cs2d and some other shooters. Anyway if you would like to hear more things about myself feel free to ask.<br /><br />My native language is german. I speak pretty well french and as you can see english. My english skills aren&#039;t the best but I am trying to improve them as good as I can. Furthermore I speak little bit turkish.<br /><br />I would like to be MOD in HC FUN. The reason therefor is that there are many hackers and rule breakers, due to my experience as a MOD in FWS/TAB/KGB2D Servers I could be a big help in this position. The server is very popular so I think there is actually a need of new mods.<br /><br />My activity is quite okay. Don&#039;t be scared that I am not a VIP at the moment, due to the reason cs2d update on 1.0.0.2 and the mac version had several bugs. So I couldn&#039;t play for a week. Of course I will try to look after the server as often as I can in the future.<br /><br />I hope you enjoyed my application.<br /><br />Name: Kingakis<br />USGN: 68925<br /><br />Regards<br />Kingakis<br /><br />E:<br />VIP is now back again.

				I usually don&#039;t get involved in moderator applications, but I saw him insulting another player today. The reason was that the player had tripped a mine and killed him. It looked like it was accidental so I really don&#039;t understand the reason for insulting. Perhaps I misinterpreted the situation?

He did it 2x, and then in the other round he throw a HE and put me on 10hps or so, then I voted him. In the same round he run then himself in a mine to kill me (I think then he wrote &quot;it was a mistake&quot;) next round -&gt; speed round, he lost nearly all of his hp and run again into the mine.(of course &quot;randomly&quot; I stand again beside him..)<br /><br />Well but anyway this isn&#039;t a explain why I insult him. Was wrong from me, won&#039;t happen again. Normally I try to stay cool, but this one he still said over and over again that he didnt make it on purpose, so I got angry. Sorry for that.
