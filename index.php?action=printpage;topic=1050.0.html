				http://hotchills.org/index.php/topic,1028.0.html<br /><br />It has been a month since i applied for jmod, so i decided to apply again, i thought 1 month should be enough to prove I am worthy of such position (Smod)<br /><br /><br />Hum....a new objective of mine is to be nice with every player in the server (including the haters)<br /><br />*EDIT: The main reason why I am applying for Smod is to permanently ban hackers.*<br /><br />Regards.

				Are you joking? Most SMods spent more than a half year before they got promoted a second time. You had already a special decision at your first promotion like you&#039;ve said, a few days after your first apply. Futhermore at last time there were also more problems with your behaviour as current Moderator, so don&#039;t think that one month is enough time that you can get promoted again.

				@piWi even if i had problems in the past most of them were fake, and the real one I&#039;ve correctly apologize to the players i&#039;ve offended in any way, if that&#039;s is not being a good mod, what is, also I&#039;ve done a really great job over the past days/months, have you noticed the amounth of players I&#039;ve reported (hackers?), even if i do not get promoted i will still report them eitherway, hacker deserve to be banned from every&nbsp; server in cs2d, hacking is not OKAY!?<br /><br />Also i agree with Se7en.

				TBH, I agree with PiWi, disagree with Se7en. Yes, as you mentioned, you did a good job in reporting hackers/spammers/ddoser etc etc. But seriously I couldn&#039;t find any reason to apply for a promotion. I might apply for S-Mod next time but what&#039;s the point of applying a higher rank when you can do almost every commands as Mod. S-Mod is just a higher rank to be respected by lowers anyway. Characters built overtime. <br /><br />This is my opinion anyway, no offense. Still, good luck.

				@siN, you&#039;re saying about yourself that you did a <strong>great</strong> job? Mate, that seems arrogant. You abused more times, saying sorry is okay if you do not again.<br />Secondly, you are reporting that many hackers, that is good but it kind useless because firstly admins aren&#039;t that active and futhermore you have no proofs for your report and finally the effort to ban a hacker if isn&#039;t on the server is to high because most of the hackers are able to change their IP that fast.<br />@Se7en, that wrong, the 5years guy would get promoted, time is important and if a mod abused in 1 , only 3 times, than he&#039;s better than somebody who did the same in one month.
