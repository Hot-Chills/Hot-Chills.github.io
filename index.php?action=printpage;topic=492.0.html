				On request I have added killstreak sounds to the server. They are off by default so you will have to press F2 and then choose <em>Configuration</em> and <em>Killstreak</em> to turn them on. You have two other options: to show only the text, but no sound or the other way around.

				Good job mate.<br /><br />Hope people will stop complaining now.<br /><br />Also, whatever Maciek tells you about me and what he&#039;s doing to me, don&#039;t give in. Keep the default setting &quot;OFF&quot;.

Laggy in what way? Do the players freeze or is it just the sound that lags behind?

				I think Its worth to mention about the sound in F1 button.Where info about server is, it might be useful when new players join server.

				Zero lags, game is fluently. The only one thing you should do, is makig something like advertising &quot;Visit hotchills.org&quot; which is written in white colour and appears sometimes. Make something like Configuration&gt;killstteak ON, to give knowledge about them to newcomers

				It&#039;s a nice addition but as it&#039;s said they&#039;re a bit laggy. for instance when I died all the sounds stopped working then when I became alive again all the sounds that I should&#039;ve heard when I was dead all started at once. I&#039;m not how to put it otherwise but I hope you understood me :)

It sounds like a bug in CS2D or perhaps something caused by problems with your internet connection. Do you experience other kinds of lag in CS2D?

				There are no lags in my case. Lags are probably because of your FPS dropping (some background program running other than cs2d) or your internet lacks the connectivity.

Anyway I&#039;m going to re-enable the sounds and keep them for 3days-week if I face the same problem again I&#039;ll report it.
