				Bosnia i do not know for what reason you have been banned but i really don&#039;t think we can trust <strong><span class="bbc_u">you</span></strong> more than we trust our <strong><span class="bbc_u">team</span></strong>. So yes if you really are 100 prcent sure that you have been blamed for no valuable reason please do as Bonzo said.

				I was online this time, together with DaBoss.&nbsp; <br />That speedhacking thing was indeed a lag. And we both think that you are a really good player!<br /><br />The main point was, that you never went a wrong way, you always walked straight to your enemy, even if he <br />was on the other side of the map. And in the rounds with the portal gun, you always knew<br />exactly when some enemy was near one of your portals, no matter how far the portal was away.<br /><br />Explain this to us, please.

First round i watched you, I actually thought that you didn&#039;t have the radar but I watched you a further 10 rounds and with each i was getting more and more sure about your hacks until in the last round, so allow me to explain what happened. <br /><br />You made a teleport on one side and the other away where you couldn&#039;t see (or hear) what happens at the first and you stood by the second, Chilla walked close to the first teleport and you amazingly walked through your 2nd teleport to go beside Chilla and shot her immidiately. I mean if I wasn&#039;t watching you for radar I&#039;d have also banned you for aimbot.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry but for me you&#039;re not worth an unban but it&#039;s not my choice to make.

				Wow, it is going crazy right now....<br /><br />On the one hand, i completely understand his reaction and his argumentation sounds very good to me, he doesnt &quot;behave&quot; like a hacker, i mean. On the other hand, what i have seen i cant deny. My main reason for consulting you to hack was that you faced directly to the player, when you used a portal. Means, in the moment you left a portal you were looking straight to the enemy, while the other portal was about 40 tiles away... Oh, my, i sound diplomatic but I really am not sure about you....
