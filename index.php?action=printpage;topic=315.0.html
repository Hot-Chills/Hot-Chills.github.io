				Today 2013.11.24 11.54 I got 4Free kicks from server, Reason: &quot;Idle&quot;, But how? i just came...&nbsp; I think for free kicks is responsible <strong>Crazy Leonidas &lt;3</strong>. Because he is very &quot;petulant (http://images.sodahead.com/polls/002769583/4726943919_crybaby_2_answer_1_xlarge.png)&quot;. :P If im wrong, i would love to know who is responsible for this. :]

				Out of curiosity I checked the logs. Seems like Leonidas and some &quot;Noob Guy&quot; have been having fun with their commands.<br />Also, one of the kicks had Hacking/Cheating for a reason. That&#039;s all I got before the server got hit by what I presume was a DDoS attack.
