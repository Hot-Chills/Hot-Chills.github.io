				1st Suggestion<br /><br />There must to be 60 percent of server players who votes &quot;yes&quot; for punishing someone, who brake rules.<br />Punishment:<br />Hacking/Cheating - Temporary ban for 1 day.<br />Flaming/Insulting - Mute for 1,5 hour.<br />Abusing Powers - Temporary ban for 5 hours.<br />Spamming - Mute for 1 hour.<br />Destroying/Blocking - Speclock for 30 minutes.<br />Idle - Kick<br /><br />2nd Suggestion<br /><br />As we know, simple players and VIPs don&#039;t have power to vote mods/admins. I think we should enable vote reason &quot;Abusing Powers&quot; to simple players, so if some mod/admin is abusing, then player&#039;s votes will be able to ban him temporary - for his abusing. And no one will be able to unban him.

				Since most of players are retarded, i say no. They will vote me everytime (eveyone who doesnt like me). I specially tried to get this rank here to be unavailible for low skilled low bobs.<br />1sr suggestion is bad too, i saw more than once when players voted out innocent player. Democracy is most fucktarded system. I am about monarchy or dictatorship.<br />I am not trustful because i see how stupid people can be. Too many newbies and jealous players.

				@Bounty Hunter , I wanna say you something about this .. <br />The players will vote the innocent players . admins , mods too! so I&#039;m not recommending this . This possible make all players banned. I mean the innocent one&#039;s then they spam the forum . they are no possibilities . Vote systems takes an effort!

[...] I am about monarchy or dictatorship. [...]<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Totally agreed. Democra<em>z</em>y is nice n stuff, but the internet, and especially this game, needs a strong dictator to rule, supported by his handpicked moderator-minions. There are just too many immature children around to handle even such minor powers, so giving them the power to do stupid stuff will lead to stupid stuff happening.<br /><br />And as these moderators are handpicked, there is no need for a &quot;vote-temp-ban-mods/admins&quot;-script thingy, I hope.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for the suggestions, though!<br />
