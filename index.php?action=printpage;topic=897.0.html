				1- Breif Introduction:<br /><br />Good evening to all.<br />My name is Jakob. I am 15 years old and have birthday at 24. February 00. I chose the name ||~piWI~|| ingame but i try to find a new name and i change the symbols around my name often, so the general name is only &#039;piWi&#039; ! my USGN number is 144441 and this apply has the purpose to become a mod.<br /><br />2- Personal information:<br /><br />I am a German boy and my mom and my dad are both germans o.O i speak the general basics of the languages: English, French and my mother tongue German. Otherwise, I have 2 brothers , one 18 years old and a twin.<br /><br />3- How good is my English:<br /><br />Some teacher like my english, some dont like my english. i am not really good in to say my strengths and weaknesses. but i am sure that i can say clear sentence and a bit more&nbsp; :-[<br /><br />4- Skills in-game<br /><br />i dont really know how long i am playing CS2D but i think i have tactics and some of game plays i can good and some of them not so good. i think that i can play quite well.<br /><br />i had make a map, but without succes. i wanted to start a server o.O but i cant script and i dont find someone to make me the right script.<br />but in these things i havent any quailifications.<br /><br />5-&nbsp; Why would you accept me:<br /><br />Uhh :D difficult question.<br />i think that i am an activ player of hc fun. IRAN TOWN and HC FUN are my favourit server of all and the player on hc fun most of them are pros and if a hacker come only all vote him. but sometimes only a few player of 3 to 6 on hc fun and than a hacker comes. so than were not so pros online, if i can say that ( ~.~ ) and than i have to left server because so assh**** ! and otherwise not many mods online if i come on hc fun. often i met ROHAN or XOOT. other mods i had never seen...<br /><br />How Active I will be:<br /><br />I am only 15 years old and so i have school and other hobbys. but i have a normal PC time ^^ this time is 16:00 to 19:00 in german time. if hc fun is online i will join it.<br /><br />6- My personal opinion:<br /><br />uh :P hc fun is one of the most popular servers and i like to join this server. i have a BIG respect of the creator of this server. it was and is still a brilliant idea ! iran town and hc fun are so nice server. the only reason why i play CS2D yet :P this is a so special time of playing on my pc. i love it &lt;3 :D<br />an alle deutsche oder so, wenn ihr wollt sagt mir ruhig mal auf deutsch hallo wenn ihr mich seht ;P<br /><br />i hope i will get at least some feed back for the future . thank you all

				Hey piWi,<br /><br />Not sure if you remember, but we have already met on ares construction a while back. I was/am a mod there and I&#039;m a mod here as well. <br /><br />So yeah, you better remember me :P<br /><br />Anyway, he is a cool guy, never saw him crossing any line on either of the servers. He always spoke and acted with respect and he would be a good addition to the moderating team.<br /><br />Eventhough I&#039;m not a great fan of 15 year-olds when it comes to moderating, I think he is mature enough for JMod and future promotions even.<br /><br /><strong>Good luck! +1 from me.</strong>
