				And there goes the respect I posted about 5 minutes ago.. You see, Crysis is Siprox&#039;s brother, not a multiaccount. I accepted Crysis because he&#039;s Siprox&#039;s brother, that means he should be trustworthy. Think about it: Why should Siprox make a second account to be accepted again? He&#039;s already a SMod. Makes no sense. Oh and Siprox didn&#039;t mute you for no reason. You are server-famous for spamming and insulting other people. So I suggest being quiet for a while, earning some respect and then <strong>maybe</strong> applying.<br /><br />EDIT: And fix your english too :p

				Reviving and old topic for just that eh? ;D Well, I&#039;m interested in other stuff mostly, so you won&#039;t be seeing me often. I sometimes join the server to play for like 15 minutes, but that&#039;s all. If I would have played CS2D non stop 1 year+ then I would have gone nuts. Seriously, I can&#039;t play the same game over and over again. Some, great games, I can. But not this one.

				So.. aint that time to remove urself from administration like Bonzo? Yeah it is :D Its simple that players like this boutny should get your powers, for example he is most active on forum last days and if he continue i would give him adm. Just keep being active<br />U are good adm, wise and resposible but not active that much. Its time to face it.\<br /><br />N is also that acitve. I wouldnt be as active as he is. I am having strange periods in which i am extremaly acitve but its not enough for this role. I think both of them (i would rather say N cause he is older :) = more experienced and trustfully, less hormons etc) would be great for this role.<br /><br />Destroyer is even less active than you. Thats why there nothing happens. But well, i understand it shard to promote anybody even to jmod since i prove that one of them wanted it only to safe cheat. Anything new wont be better than old things, but now we are only gettin worse and worse cause of inactive members. Its just my opinion, you dont need to agree with me. I am just a guy who plays constatly this game since 2006 xd i must be wierd

				Who said I should play the game, if I started to dislike it? The administrating isn&#039;t only about playing, not at all. Plus, I don&#039;t think many of you would want me to leave, if so, go ahead do something about it. However, I&#039;m not ready to retire, not yet.<br /><br />Oh, and you said &quot;Thats why there nothing happens&quot;. What should happen? Do you actually think something will change?<br /><br />EDIT: Oh and about activity, at forums I&#039;m really active, not at the server.

				Nah, just every apply waits so long cause you dont have enough knowledge about those players. Ofc, nobody wants you to leave, but there should be someone more active, 3rd adm

				I agree with Turkey, administration is not only about being active in the game. Besides, we all have a life outside the internet and that must be respected. Just speaking for myself, I have full confidence in the admin team.

				Bonzo (i dont count him) destro, turkey, (happy + ele -&gt; also dont count) I dont know about somebody?<br /><br />Also nobody of them aint that active like N&#039;. I would give some priviliges to him but not pernamently. As long as he is that active he should get admin. If he stop being that active, remove or something then search anybody else who is that active.<br />Thats and idea. On adm rang should be given to player who is most active on server and he is known here (Random players should get that power, just trustful guyz)<br /><br />Ehm i dont know if he wants. It was just example, cause i am nto sure he is interested. Well maybe its best atm.. just if there creat a possiblity you should make something with this ;p

				(Replying to first topics under my):<br />@Turkey<br />I knew, that this is old topic, but if I want to say something for You it, it&#039;s better than creating new one.<br />And, idc, I like this game. Anyway, it isn&#039;t as bad game as Stranded II or Stranded I :D<br />@Maciek<br />Agree with You, Turkey and Destroyer Ita must be more active. They are admins so their job is take care of server and forum.
