				Hello guys, girls, and AhmedStrike.<br /><br />I still like this Community, Forum, and the Servers. As always, there are hackers, insulters (people that is seriously insulting another one), and something that makes me feel sick, spammers.<br /><br />1) In game name: Mast@, Evegeri, Melssm, Lowe, Comb., Masty.<br /><br />2) USGN ID: 153457<br /><br />3) USGN Username: Mast<br /><br />4) Have you had any prior experience as a moderator? JMod at HC//Fun, (you know what have happened). Supporter at -[Dream]- Forum, Administrator at -[Dream]- Servers (Still I am). JMod at #C Sparta (closed because of ddos). MOD2 at old vC| Deathrun (no money for servers), S-VIP at DR# Servers (I&#039;m not sure, but I think S-VIP doesn&#039;t count as a &#039;&#039;Moderator&#039;&#039;).<br /><br />5) Why exactly do you want to be a Mod/SMod ?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I still like this Community, Forum, and the Servers.

First of all, my thread become a quote. Secondly, I refreshed the website and I couldn&#039;t see the page. Thirdly, 1 min later, someone disabled my Wi-Fi. Finally, I tried to edit my apply, and instead of editing it, another post appeared with my apply edited. Weird.

				This might seem odd but congrats Mast for being accepted as a jMod. You had been persistent on the forum even after being demoted and thats a nice quality. I know that you are very active on the community and its good, cause we need more people like you on the server. I am actually very happy since I&#039;m not much active these days, and I appreciate your energy and dedication towards HC//Fun. Respect.<br />Hope the community benefits from your approval<br />Regards<br />Griff
