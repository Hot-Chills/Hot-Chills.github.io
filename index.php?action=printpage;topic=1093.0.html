				I&#039;m playing CS2D since 2012. When I first played in HC // Fun, I enjoyed those changing rounds. It was smth new to me. But only today, while playing I realized, that there are no major changes in tileset, since the time I first played in this server. Only on xmas Happy would change snowy tileset for like about a month, and then the old back tileset is back - for a whole year again. Went to Fws doghouse today, they&#039;re changing map and tiles more often, than HC // Fun original tiles are changed with some new ones. Ofc Happy wouldn&#039;t agree to change map, he should remake the whole round system, but in my opinion, we should do some (at least small) changes in original tileset, add some variety. Maybe this would attract more players. Just my suggestion.

				Happy Camper is lazy? Lord Happy Camper is lazy? <br />The creator of all the worlds, the space, is lazy? The guy who finished war in real life and started another one&nbsp; in CS2D is lazy?<br /><br />------------------------------<br /><br />I think its a really good idea. HC// Fun is becoming boring.

				As you already guessed, I am not so fond of replacing the map completely. Using a new tileset requires no changes to the script, so that would be acceptable.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have the time to do it myself, but if someone is willing to do it, please go ahead. If I think the result is good, I will put it on the server.

				Old dust/sand theme would be still good, it just need modification, for example, tunel walls would be from steel now, as well as the walls of the tt/ct bases, palms could be a little more &quot;green&quot; :D , would be nice to add some little structures at map&#039;s east-west corner, down the water place, it&#039;s boring, mostly players wouldn&#039;t even go there without getting chased after xD
