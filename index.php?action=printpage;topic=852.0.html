				Introduction / personal information:<br /><br />1.ingame info about me:<br />Sorry for putting a link into there, but im going to apply via my phone and i really have to write a book about my cs2d history so forgive me this mistake ( even skiped like 70% on that intro and simply copying the text wouldnt be honest so i decided to play with open cards ) http://theanalbagels.eu/index.php?threads/some-bagelised-info.56/#post-439<br /><br />2.private info about me:<br />Well as i really like to not share my life on the internet i&#039;ll be short on this task. I&#039;m 24 years old and my name is Timo. I already left my parents home to make up my own life with my babe. Im working atleast 40hours a week but thats fine for me. My hobbies are graphicdesigns, fitness and other random stuff. <br /><br />English skills:<br />Some people already rated me with 9/10. Sure im able to communicate, but i would rather choose a 7 or 8 out of 10 for my english vocabulary.<br /><br />In-game skills:<br />I had a few breaks for now but everytime i came back i also improved my skills so nowadays i would rate myself as a mid+ gamer, im good but not professional like some tournament players are, but that&#039;s enough for me.<br />Im also skilled in game designing, mapping and sound editing/creation. The only thing im not really interested in is scripting even if i know the basics.<br /><br />Additional:<br />I&#039;ve been active on HC&#039;s Fun server for about 2 years now and always noticed a lack of moderation in the time i have played, so i decided to apply&nbsp; to help closing the moderation lacks in game and become part of a already well doing team. As this is one of the most successful servers in cs2d i&#039;d really like to keep it up as long as im able to, which brings me to the point about my activity.i&#039;ll be playing for about 5-8h a week, would be more if i got more time for it but sadly i dont.<br />As i already proven myself as a moderator or part of the administration team aswell i think i got a deserved chance here too. <br /><br />Expericence in administration or community member roll:<br />Gfxler - cs2dworld<br />Mod - cs2dusers<br />S-Mod - NGM<br />ADM - infinity<br />Vcl - NoPain<br />Mod - Theanalbagels<br />Mod - Gears<br /><br />

				Well that might be right bounty (thanks for pointing this anyway ;) ) but im not that way active to deserve a position like that. S-mod would be perfect because i could permanently ban hackers etc. (There are tons of them at HC Fun and giving 1day temporary bans isnt the best solution for them even if few of these guys use dynamic ip adresses.)
