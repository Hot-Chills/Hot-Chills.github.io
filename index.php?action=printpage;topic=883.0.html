				I&#039;m a little bit surprised by both of your age and language skills.<br /><br />I thought you were at least a little bit older (you are more mature than most 13-year-olds) and I also assumed your english was way better than this.<br /><br />Anyway, If I wouldn&#039;t know you I would protest against accepting based on this application, but fortunately I do know you.<br /><br />Snoop is one of the most active regulars and he is <strong>FANTASTIC</strong> at spotting cheaters. He notices very subtle hints of cheat I would never imagine myself seeing. Today he pm&#039;d me about a guy who walked at normal pace during a speed round and told me its a cheat engine&#039;s doing. Obviously that wasn&#039;t enough to ban so I went to spec, started recording and immobilized the guy (-100 speed) and guess what, he kept moving like nothing happened. <br /><br />Wait for Xoot to see this application, I&#039;m sure he will leave a positive feedback too!<br /><br />Admins, please mind that his english is more than enough to carry on a conversation even if it may not appear so.<br />I honestly recommend approving him because - as said above - he is quite expectional at spotting cheaters.<br /><br /><strong>Good luck!</strong>

				The thing is, besides being able to catch the people who violate the rules, a mod should be able to communicate with other players.

				Well he really is a nice guy and i expected his english skills would be better, he&#039;s always able to communicate on a proper way when i meet him ingame so no clue what happened here. Snoop always spots hackers etc on a really reliable way which is a big help for us but im not sure if jmod would suit him after reading his application. Im kinda confused right now..

				@SnoopDog 2 SMODS expected alot from you, which is a big thing. But your application is ruining the chance of you getting accepted. I am not sure whether you did those spelling and grammar mistakes on purpose or your english skills are not that good. On the other hand, XoOt and AREIOS claim that you&#039;re very good at spotting hackers/cheaters. A moderator should be good in both moderation and communication. I think you can do moderation quite well. But you lack in communication skills as Elfing said&nbsp; before.<br />I am giving you one more chance. Edit your application if you made those mistakes on purpose.<br />I&#039;ll be testing you in game too.(So be active) I want Mods to do the same. Do test him and lemme know whether your opinion changes about him or not. If you fail to prove yourself, then the result is very clear.<br />Goodluck!
