				Blame me for being a super realism creep again, but your english skills are more like a 5,5-6 out of 10. I know some ppl who are almost able to speak fluently and write without basic mistakes like you did alot(simple past, past present etc.) and their english skills are just about 8-8,5. The apply itself is quite ok, but not enough to make me saying &quot;dayum HC needs that guy&quot; therefore im neutral about your application, good luck anyway.
